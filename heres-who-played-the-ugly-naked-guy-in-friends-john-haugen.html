The series, which ran for a whopping 10 years, gave rise to the careers of Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, and Lisa Kudrow, to name a few, however, one character in the show that never really got their big shot, was Ugly Naked Guy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sitcoms have been keeping the identity of countless characters secret for quite some time! Fans would remember Wilson Wilson Jr. from <a href=#>Home Improvement</a> being kept behind the fence the entire time, well the same can be said for Ugly Naked Guy from Friends.</p><p>With <a href=#>the series reunion</a> having aired earlier this year, fans began to wonder whether or not the actor who played Ugly Naked Guy would make an appearance. Although he wasn't in attendance, that hasn't stopped viewers from wondering who he is.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Friends Fans Think This Is The Moment The Show Died</a></span></p><h2 id=remember-ugly-naked-guy>Remember Ugly Naked Guy?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ugly Naked Guy was a staple character for the first five seasons of Friends, that is until Ross Geller takes over the space and moves across from Mon and Chandler's! Despite being talked about by the six friends, poked with chopsticks, and bribed with mini muffins, Ugly Naked Guy's identity always remained a secret.</p><p>The series creators kept who Ugly Naked Guy was a secret, one that even the cast wasn't too sure about when asked. Although the role was one discussed quite often on Friends, viewers were only ever to get a glimpse of his torso and hair. While his red curls and decision to live nude were the only bits of info fans really knew of him, they wanted more, and so do we!</p><p>Well, HuffPost decided to take matters into their own hands, and finally go on a hunt for the actor who played the notorious character. This all came about in 2016 when Todd Van Luling did a deep diva into the matter, managing to actually find the actor's name, or so he thinks!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At first, it was assumed that actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Hagerty was the actor behind Ugly Naked Guy</a>, the same actor who played the building superintendent, Mr. Treeger, however, Hagerty shot down those rumors quickly, leaving reporter Van Luling with some more work to do!</p><p>As the Friends reunion came closer and closer, fans began to wonder whether he would make an appearance or not, since the six of 'em got up to a lot when it came to invading the guy's privacy! Well, when asked about who played the role, the cast couldn't place a name, or a face to be honest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering the character didn't have very much screen time, casting didn't seem to be an issue, therefore, not too many people in the cast and crew really remember any details either. Luckily for fans of the series, Todd's hard work wasn't for nothing. After speaking with Jennifer Bender, who worked in central casting at the time, Van Luling was finally let in on who played the iconic role.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>People React To Jennifer Aniston's Comments About Cutting Off Unvaccinated Friends</a></span></p><h2 id=ugly-naked-guy-39-s-identity-revealed>Ugly Naked Guy's Identity Revealed!</h2><p>After tirelessly trying to track down the name, it was reported that John Haugen was actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the name attached to the character.</a> Haugen himself has claimed he is, in fact, the man who played Ugly Naked Guy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actor's IMDb page</a>, he is credited with the role, however, it's clear he didn't profit too much off of playing the nude guy next door, since he didn't go on to appear in much else beforehand or afterward. While there isn't any sure way to verify whether Haugen is the actor who played Ugly Naked Guy, Luling took his word, and considering the resemblance is quite on point, it's definitely looking as if the match is right!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>A 'Friends' And 'Seinfeld' Crossover Nearly Happened</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tM5mp6WZqZqxbsDHnmSun5yueq%2Btyp6bZp%2BlrnqquoyfqaKdnpnAbrbOoaVmoJGqtKa6jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hilary-duff-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hilary Duff Net Worth 2023; How Rich Is The American Actress Hilary Duff?">&larr;
