She comes from a well-known family of musicians, prompting her to enter the industry at an early age alongside her sister, Sharona Pick. Her father, Svika Pick is a singer while her mother, Mirit Shem-Or is a songwriter. Aside from music, Tarantino's wife has also forayed into acting. According to IMDb, she played Daphna Ben-Cobo in <a href=#>her husband's very own Oscar-winning movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a>.

Aside from working as a singer, model, and influencer, Pick also considers her part in Tarantino's filmmaking process as another full-time job. "When Quentin shoots a movie, it's a big deal," she revealed. "Obviously, I take an active part in it, and [it influences] all the atmosphere at home."</p><p>She continued: "It's a very intensive half a year and every day is very important. It's like being with someone who is training for the Olympics, or as Quentin always says, it's like climbing Everest. Quentin is a champion at that. He is so charming, caring and professional. He makes everyone feel great on the set. It made me feel really proud to see that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Margot Robbie Admitted To Stealing From Set After Playing Harley Quinn</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-quentin-tarantino-meet-his-wife-daniella-pick>How Did Quentin Tarantino Meet His Wife Daniella Pick?</h2><p>Tarantino met his future wife in 2009 when he was promoting Inglorious Basterds in Israel.

"We are very family-oriented, we love to be at home, to go out to dinner [and] to watch movies, both at home and at theaters," she shared. "Aside from that, I love to cook and invite friends over, and I also cook every day. Quentin really loves my cooking and I make things that I know from home and also new things, I love the kitchen." She added that they "spend a lot of time during the day together, laughing, talking."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He's a gentleman, romantic, funny and a hunk... He's a genius and an incredible husband," Pick said of the Oscar winner. For the last couple of years, the two lived in Israel, away from the limelight. "The idea was that we would spend like three to four months in Tel Aviv and three to four months in Los Angeles and then COVID hit," Tarantino told Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2021. "So three to four months became nine to 12 months."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio's Career Regrets Are Both Shocking And Completely Understandable</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuvdSepa2hnmLBor7Ap6uipp%2Boeri1xZ5knZmenrKtuMBmp6Kbm2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zarina-mehta.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zarina Mehta Height, Weight, Age, Family, Biography">&larr;
