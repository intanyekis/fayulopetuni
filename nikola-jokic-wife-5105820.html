Most recently, Nikola and his team <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>beat the Miami Heat</a> in the 2023 NBA Finals, and Nikola was named the NBA Finals MVP. He has played against some of the biggest names in basketball, including <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>LeBron James</strong></a>. Aside from Nikola‚Äôs work as an athlete, he is often spotted on his wife‚Äôs Instagram account being a sweet hubby.

Nikola and his leading lady tied the knot in Oct. 2020, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. Although Natalija married her longtime love in 2020, she proved her loyalty years prior when she moved to Denver when Nikola joined the Nuggets in 2015. The blonde beauty is often spotted supporting her husband on the sidelines and shares photos of him via Instagram often.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In Nov. 2020, Natalija took to Instagram to share a throwback photo of the time she and Nikola got <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>engaged</a>. ‚Äújanuary 2020,‚Äù she captioned the adorable <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>black-and-white selfie</a>. In the snapshot, Natalija held up her hand and flashed her giant engagement ring while her then-fianc√© grinned in the background. Later, on Nov. 13, 2020, she shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romantic photo</a> from the time they had their first dance at their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding</a>. She captioned the post simply with the date of Oct. 2020.</p><h2>How Did Nikola Jokic Meet Natalija?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Natalija‚Äôs romance with Nikola started when they were just teenagers, as they were in fact, high school sweet hearts. One of the earliest photos of him on her Instagram page is from Jan. 2014. ‚Äúcome just as you are to me, and I will love you unconditionally,‚Äù she captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of Nikola puckering up at the camera.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>His wife has clearly been his biggest fan from the start, as she featured an adorable <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of her wearing his jersey in Apr. 2016. By May of that year, Natalija shared a black-and-white <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of her and her husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>packing on the PDA</a>. She captioned the post with a simple red heart emoji. Although his wife has shared many photos of their romance over the years, Nikola does not appear to have a public Instagram account at this time.</p><h2>Does Nikola Jokic Have Kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Soon after they got married, Natalija gave birth to their daughter <strong>Ognjena</strong> in Sept. 2021. The proud mom took to Instagram three months later to show off a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> her then-growing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby bump</a>. ‚ÄúThank you 2021, you were my favorite so far,‚Äù she captioned the sweet snapshot of her pregnant belly. Later, in May 2022, Natalija shared the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first photo</a> of their daughter via Instagram. She captioned the post with a Ferris wheel emoji and a white heart, as her Ognjena gazed at her dad‚Äôs ‚ÄúMost Valuable Player‚Äù award.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nikola Jokic and his daughter shared a moment after Game 2, pointing to their ring finger ‚ù§Ô∏è üíç <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/XQWJrDHtuV</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>‚Äî Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 2, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Most recently, on May 1, 2023, Nikola was supported by his wife and daughter at his victorious game against the Phoenix Suns. When the little one saw her dad on the basketball court, she sweetly cheered and pointed to her hand. Her dad adorably reciprocated and mimicked her same movement (watch <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>).</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Nikola‚Äôs wife and daughter <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebrated the NBA superstar‚Äôs championship win</a> with the Denver Nuggets on June 12. The NBA posted a video on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> of the sweet family of three posing with the Nuggets‚Äô trophy, as well as Nikola‚Äôs MVP trophy. Nikola and Natalija gave their daughter kisses as she stood between them, wearing a Denver Nuggets t-shirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme82ioqikkWK3sLfInGSwoZaaenZ9j25va2hf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./charles-kimbrough.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charles Kimbrough">&larr;
