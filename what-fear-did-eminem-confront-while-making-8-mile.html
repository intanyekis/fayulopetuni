In reality, however, true bravery is being afraid of something for whatever reason and still pushing yourself to face your fear for the greater good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Hollywood, some celebrities spend their career doing the same thing over and over again. For example, many people believe actors like Jason Statham, Zooey Deschanel, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Rodriquez, and Patrick Dempsey <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">play the same character</a> in everything. Of course, considering all of those actors are fantastic at what they do, it is very hard to blame them for playing similar characters all of the time.</p><p>When it comes to <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem</a></strong>, he has proven himself to be a jack of all trades. After all, he may have initially risen to fame due to his more comedic music but in recent years, he has released a slew of serious songs. On top of that, Eminem has proven himself to be a talented record producer. Finally, Eminem was brave enough to put himself out there by starring in a semi-autobiographical movie called 8 Mile. When it comes to 8 Mile, it turns out that while making the film Eminem had to do something that freaked him out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Miley Cyrus Fears Most</a></span></p><h2 id=all-time-great>All-Time Great</h2><p>When it comes to music, everyone has their preferences and that is perfectly ok. That said, there is no doubt that certain performers are a lot more respected than others. In the case of Eminem, he has to be considered among the best rappers of all-time simply based on how respected he is among his peers. For example, the website southpawer.com has compiled quotes of famous rappers like Redman, Fat Joe, Rakim, Nas, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">praising Eminem’s talents</a>.</p><p>On top of the fact that Eminem’s peers respect him, he has legions of devoted fans who’ve been following his career for years at this point. In fact, many of Eminem’s songs get <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">streamed constantly</a> on services like Spotify, including “Lose Yourself”, “’Til I Collapse”, “Love the Way You Lie”, and “Without Me”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At Fat Joe And Eminem's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=movie-star>Movie Star</h2><p>After the release of Eminem’s major-label debut album, “The Slim Shady LP” in 1999, he remained extremely busy releasing two more albums in the years 2000 and 2002. Despite all of the time Eminem spent in music studios over those years and the fact that he toured the world performing, he still found the time to star in the 2002 movie 8 Mile.</p><p>Throughout Hollywood history, many musicians have tried to become actors only to fail miserably after starring in universally panned movies. When it comes to Eminem, however, to date he has starred in only one movie, 8 Mile, and it won acclaim from moviegoers and critics, did well financially, and has passed the test of time. On top of all that, Eminem won an Oscar for his original song from 8 Mile, and “Lose Yourself” remains so beloved that he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">performed it at the 2020 Academy Awards</a> ceremony.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Times Musicians Tried To Act In Movies (And Failed)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eminem-s-unusual-fear>Eminem’s Unusual Fear</h2><p>In the year 2008, Eminem released his autobiography which was named after his hit song “The Way I Am”. During the book, he touched on his difficult upbringing, his rise to fame, his struggles with addiction and depression, and his take on the most controversial moments of his career. Additionally, “The Way I Am” touched on the filming of Eminem’s acclaimed movie, 8 Mile.</p><p>To the surprise of virtually everyone, “The Way I am “ touched on a deleted scene from 8 Mile and why Eminem pushed hard to have the sequence removed. “There was some weird s**t in 8 Mile too. I fought tooth and nail (and won) to get this scene with the horse out of the f*****g movie because it made no sense whatsoever. Jimmy gets in a fight with his mother and takes his little sister next door to the babysitter and then he sits down and starts crying, just thinking about his life and how f****d up everything is. But then he turns around and—get this— he sees a horse. As in one of those horses the cops ride through the city and s**t. He sees this horse in a junkyard and he doesn’t know why it’s there. He walks up and starts petting it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After referencing 8 Mile’s horse scene, Eminem made it clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">horses freak him out</a>. “Now, there’s something about horses and the way they throw their heads up-they jerk their heads around out of f*****g nowhere. Curtis kept telling me to grab the reins and pet it. But the horse was doing this crazy head-jerking movement, and I thought, Any minute this mother****r’s going to lift his head up and bust my f*****g jaw and knock me the f**k out. Horses and me, we don’t get on too well. I wouldn’t f**k with a horse. If a horse dissed me, I wouldn’t say anything back.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Kidman Is Deathly Afraid Of Butterflies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOmrdFmm6KcXZq6qrrEpmScp56bv7C602auoaGcmnqurcqipaBlaGK6qrjEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./orlando-bloom-katy-perry-relationship-romance-hard-abs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Orlando Bloom Says Romance with Katy Perry's Hard, Kinda Like His Abs">&larr;
