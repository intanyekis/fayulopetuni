Among other things, Todd said he hoped Lindsie had a better relationship with the person who was her father.</p><p class=dh>In recent weeks, Lindsie Chrisley Campbell took to Instagram to allege that she didn’t have a father and that Todd Chrisley wasn’t her biological parent. The “Chrisley Knows Best” star took to his podcast to address the claims.</p><p class=dh>On the 145th episode of “Chrisley Confessions,” the reality star mentioned that Lindsie’s posts had been shared with him. The television personality quickly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tvshowsace.com/2021/07/22/not-lindsie-chrisleys-real-father-todd-kills/>shut down his daughter’s claims</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/79eda63a67ea09f79f7d05a4e9757013.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Savannah, Todd, Julie, and Chase Chrisley, along with Lindsie Chrisley Campbell at the NBCUniversal Summer Press Day at the Four Seasons Hotel Westlake Village on April 1, 2016, in California | Photo: Shutterstock</p><p class=dh>Todd <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/145-click-bait-bloggers-and-the-best-defense-for-slander/id1430295246?i=1000529640732">explained</a> that his daughter had a father but chose to “state” that she didn’t have one. He confessed that he was her father regardless of whether she alleged he wasn’t her biological one or not.</p><p class=dh>Instead of getting upset, the reality star appeared to be taking the accusations in his stride. He also mentioned how he’d been there to raise Lindsie from childhood.</p><p class=dh>Making sure that he was clear, Todd said he knew who Lindsie belonged to and that she was his child. Even though the pair hasn’t had a healthy relationship over the years, the reality star <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/145-click-bait-bloggers-and-the-best-defense-for-slander/id1430295246?i=1000529640732">added</a>:</p><p class=dh>“I love her, and will die loving her.”</p><p class=dh>However, he also confessed that they didn’t have a relationship. Todd explained that things wouldn’t change between him and his daughter unless God intervened in it because there’d been too much hurt over the years.</p><p class=dh>The duo <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/379676/this-is-how-todd-chrisley-lost-all-of-his-money/>ended up estranged</a> when Lindsie eloped in 2012 with Will Campbell, her current husband, without Todd's permission. In 2017, she left the family’s reality show and spoke about it on her "Coffee Convos" podcast.</p><p class=dh>She once told “Life and Style” that she’d felt like an outcast in her family even though they hadn’t made her feel that intentionally. In 2019, when Todd and his wife, Julie Chrisley, were indicted on fraud and tax evasion charges.</p><p class=dh>His eldest daughter alleged that her father and younger half-brother Chase had threatened to release her sex tape if she didn't cooperate with the indictment case. She even filed a police report.</p><p class=dh>Todd has since claimed <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tvshowsace.com/2021/07/22/todd-chrisley-debunks-lindsie-bombshell/>he has proof</a> that confirms his son Kyle, his ex-wife, Lindsie, and Todd’s former CEO all spoke to the Georgia Department of Revenue. The group allegedly hoped to bring charges against him and Julie.</p><p class=dh>However, the family patriarch has since healed his relationship with Kyle because he owned up and apologized for what he did. Todd also suggested Kyle was a pawn being used by Lindsie and his ex-wife.</p><p class=dh>Today, Todd and his daughter still don’t talk, and she doesn’t have a relationship with any of her family members. The pair has since stopped following each other on Instagram.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>During the episode, Kyle made his return to the series.</strong></h3><p class=dh>The television personality had Kyle and Lindsie <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.tvshowsace.com/2021/03/11/todd-chrisley-first-wife/>from his first marriage</a> to high school sweetheart Teresa Terry. After marrying Julie in May of 1996, they’ve since welcomed Chase, Savannah, and Grayson together.</p><p class=dh>Todd and Terry met in high school before they had their first child, Lindsie, and two years later, Kyle was born in 1991. After the star divorced his first wife, their children primarily lived with him because he provided financially.</p><p class=dh>When Todd married Julie, she adopted <a class="me a" href=#>Lindsie</a>, but it wasn’t clear if Kyle got adopted. In March 2021, “People” magazine released the sneak peek of “Chrisley Knows Best’s” season finale.</p><p class=dh>During the episode, Kyle <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/chrisley-knows-best-todd-chrisley-gets-very-emotional-as-he-receives-call-from-eldest-son-kyle/>made his return to the series</a>. He was seen calling his father and reaching out by asking to see him, to which Todd replied that he’d like that and said he’d call his son back.</p><p class=dh>The pair even ended their call by declaring their love for each other. Kyle lost custody of his daughter, Chloe, when she was a little girl because of his drug addiction issues, leaving her to live with his parents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmttcXFlbXq1u8OdZJygop7ArbHYZp6irpWoeqStzZ2gnWWimr2txYydmK6fmKmyb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./suzanne-somers-religion-was-she-christian-or-jewish-family-ethnicity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Was she Christian or Jewish?
