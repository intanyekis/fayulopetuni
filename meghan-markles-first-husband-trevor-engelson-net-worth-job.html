The two tied the knot in 2011, shortly after Markle landed her <a href=#>breakthrough role as Rachel Zane in Suits</a>, and enjoyed a relatively drama-free marriage until 2013 when Markle initiated divorce proceedings, citing those infamous "irreconcilable differences."</p><p>Fast-forward nearly a decade, and both Markle and Engelson have steered their ships in different directions – she, naturally, toward a<a href=#> glamorous, albeit highly controversial royal life</a> with Prince Harry, and he toward a laid-back family life with Tracey Kurland; an heiress to a multi-million-dollar empire. Now 46, Engelson didn’t just marry into wealth, he’s also been steadily amassing an impressive fortune of his own. Here's how he's been adding to his net worth since his 2013 split from Markle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-between-trevor-engelson-and-meghan-markle-that-led-to-their-2013-split>What Happened Between Trevor Engelson And Meghan Markle That Led To Their 2013 Split?</h2><p>Suits alum Meghan Markle has been making headlines since ascending to British Royal status, and not always for the right reasons. After a rather turbulent reign as the Duchess of Sussex, Markle and her husband, Prince Harry, ditched their royal duties, choosing to start fresh in North America.</p><p>However, from their explosive Netflix documentary to their unconventional breakup with Spotify, the duo's time away from the royal family has been equally, if not more controversial.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meghan-markle-was-warned-about-her-extravagant-spending-here-s-the-truth-about-how-she-enjoys-her-huge-net-worth.jpg><p>But there was a time when Markle's love life wasn't the tabloids' constant obsession.

And despite being together for six years before getting hitched, things started to fall apart not long after the wedding,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an inside source revealed to The Sun in 2021</a>. “They really battled with long distances. Trevor was based in LA while Meghan was in Toronto, a five-hour flight away. It was a very difficult way to start married life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>David And Victoria Beckham Are Avoiding Questions After Reportedly Cutting Ties With Meghan Markle And Prince Harry</a></span></p><p>Despite the pressures of maintaining a long-distance relationship, Engelson was caught completely off guard when Markle filed for divorce after just two years of marriage.</p><p>“No long-distance relationship is easy, and Meghan started drifting away from Trevor when she was in Canada," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source close to Engelson recently revealed to MailOnline</a>.</p><p>"When she told Trevor she wanted a divorce after a couple of years he was devastated.

When she took up with Prince Harry, he was crushed all over again because he was constantly reminded of her because of the publicity around the marriage and then the drama of the Oprah interview.”</p><p>However, after nearly a decade, Engelson is no longer reeling from his divorce with Markle. What’s more, unlike Markle, the now 46-year-old found even greater financial success in the wake of their divorce. According to MailOnline, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Engelson’s net worth has grown to an estimated $10 million</a>, with most of his earnings coming from his highly successful production company, Underground Films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Leaving The Royal Family Actually Impact Prince Harry's Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>And that's not all. Four years after his divorce from Markle, Engelson took the plunge into matrimony yet again, this time with Tracey Kurland, the daughter of PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust CEO Stanford Kurland.</p><p>According to MailOnline, Tracey inherited about half of her father's $500 million fortune when he passed away in 2021, which means that she and her husband now have a combined net worth of nearly $300 million.</p><h2 id=how-does-meghan-markle-rsquo-s-ex-husband-trevor-engelson-make-his-money>How Does Meghan Markle’s Ex-Husband Trevor Engelson Make His Money?</h2><p>Aside from marrying into tremendous wealth, Trevor Engelson has found some other rather inventive ways to add to his net worth. As things stand, the Hollywood producer's most significant revenue stream is his production company, Underground Films. Founded in 2001, the company has produced a number of popular films, including License to Wed, Remember Me, and All About Steve.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/engelson-season-five-snowfall-premiere.jpg><p>Though not all the projects Engelson has taken on have been massive successes, there have been a few standouts over the years. Among these is the 2007 romantic comedy License to Wed, which raked in an impressive $70.2 million against a $35 million budget, and the 2010 coming-of-age romantic drama, Remember Me, which pulled in $56 million against a measly $16 million budget. Underground Films is also involved in the production of several successful TV shows, including FX’s Snowfall and Comedy Central’s Bad Advice From My Brother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from his highly lucrative career, Engelson has also found tremendous fulfillment from his marriage with Tracey Kurland, with whom he now shares two children. “When I saw him recently, he kept going on about how he’s the happiest he’s ever been, how he loves being a dad and how he’s never felt more fulfilled,” a source close to the 46-year-old producer revealed to MailOnline.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Meghan Markle Wasn't The Richest Star On Suits: Here's Who Was</a></span></p><p>Though the harrowing aftermath of his divorce from Markle is still a sore spot, it’s quite clear that Engelson's life has taken a turn for the better. “Everyone in Trevor's life knows not to mention the 'M' word. He's moved on and, in some ways, you could say he's having an even better life than Meghan,” a source close to the producer gushed to MailOnline. “He probably has more money than she does now, he's doing what he loves, and he's out of the spotlight. It's the ultimate revenge.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknp%2BYlrtuucCroqWdo2Kzqr7SrWShraOXrq%2BwjK2pnq6fp3qmusaeo6ynnmK7psCMsKarrJhit7Cujg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pregnant-stassi-schroeder-cradles-bikini-baby-bump-during-lake-trip.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pregnant Stassi Schroeder Cradles Bikini Baby Bump During Lake Trip">&larr;
