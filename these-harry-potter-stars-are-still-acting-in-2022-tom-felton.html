Starting as kids and growing up with the series, audiences felt a sense of kinship with the cast. The other remarkable members, such as those hired to play the teachers and classmates, also received strong reactions among fans. Here are some of the actors and actresses from the Harry Potter films thar are still acting in Hollywood today.</p><h2 id=harry-melling-has-3-films-releasing-by-the-end-of-the-year><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Harry Melling Has 3 Films Releasing By The End Of The Year</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harry Melling played the highly unfavorable Dudley Dursley in this movie series, starting when he was just a young boy. Although he did not fully dive into Hollywood once the franchise ended, he did continue acting here and there. Currently, <a href=#>Melling is working on a film in which he’ll embody Edgar Allen Poe</a> as well as one movie that already released and one that is still in pre-production.</p><h2 id=fiona-shaw-is-keeping-busy-with-5-titles-underway><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Fiona Shaw Is Keeping Busy With 5 Titles Underway</span></h2><p>Aunt Petunia was played by Fiona Shaw, and she has been adding several movies and television shows to her filmography since Harry Potter ended. Not only has she already acted in episodes of Killing Eve this year, but she has two TV series in post-production, two films in pre-production, and another movie just announced in which she will be starring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=evanna-lynch-has-a-short-in-post-production><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Evanna Lynch Has A Short In Post-Production</span></h2><p>Evanna Lynch was a beloved addition to the cast list, joining halfway through the series as Luna Lovegood. <a href=#>She took a break from acting</a> in 2015 that last a few years, but got back on set and most recently released a short last year entitled You Eat Other Animals?

Since then, she has only taken a few jobs, but has just recently starred in Downton Abbey: A New Era and has two more films in the works.</p><h2 id=bonnie-wright-will-star-in-those-who-wander><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Bonnie Wright Will Star In Those Who Wander</span></h2><p>Bonnie Wright, who starred as the only Weasley sister, Ginny, has been very intentional with which jobs she would take after Harry Potter. <a href=#>She has only worked in movies and shorts</a>, acting in five films and three shorts over the course of six years. There is currently a movie in post-production called Those Who Wander, and Wright has been cast as a main role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-amp-oliver-phelps-have-a-movie-coming-out-soon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>James & Oliver Phelps Have A Movie Coming Out Soon</span></h2><p>Perhaps the most entertaining of the cast are Weasley twins Fred and George, played by real life twins James and Oliver. James has a film in pre-production called Brigantia, in which he will be a fisherman. Because these two just can’t seem to stay away from each other, <a href=#>they will also be acting in an upcoming film together</a> entitled Own Worst Enemy, though it does not have a release date set.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Of The Child Stars From The 'Harry Potter' Franchise Has Booked The Most Roles Since?</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-felton-has-been-keeping-busy-with-several-movies><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tom Felton Has Been Keeping Busy With Several Movies</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone’s favorite (well, almost everyone’s favorite) bully Draco Malfoy was played by Tom Felton.
