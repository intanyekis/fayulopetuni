"My life had blown up completely," Wentz recently told Apple Music's Zane Lowe. "I got divorced, realized I didn't really like how famous I was. Didn't love who I was."</p><p>This summer, Pete will head back out on tour in support of Fall Out Boy’s new album, So Much (for) Stardust. It is the band’s first record since 2018, and the beginning of Fall Out Boy’s third decade together as a pop rock band.</p><h2 id=how-pete-wentz-felt-when-after-his-divorce-to-ashlee-simpson><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Pete Wentz Felt When After His Divorce To Ashlee Simpson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pete-wentz-gq.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My life was just like … a bomb had gone off in it,</a>” the Fall Out Boy bassist told Nylon while reflecting on his divorce from the singer in an interview published recently.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I thought it was forever</a>," the bassist told Howard Stern in 2015.

"I had the beard, the flannel shirt. I didn't know what my identity was. That factored in. When your identity is what you do, it's hard when you stop doing it."</p><p>Wentz grew a beard just to see if he could because "It was the first time where I was like, 'Well, no one's really taking my picture. I'm just basically hanging out with my kid all day. Who cares?' I think when you stop caring about your personal appearance, your personal hygiene, it makes you even more depressed, but it makes you do it more," he explained.

But if you don't know how to have those arguments, then they become nuclear. And we were doing this all in the public eye, which as you know, it doesn't help, because you have people scrutinizing everything you do: 'He cut his hair—it's breakup hair!' It's like, 'What?!
