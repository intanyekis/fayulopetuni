Starring a wicked cast, James Mangold directs this tale about American car designer Carroll Shelby and his driver, Ken Miles, in their attempt to beat Ferrari at the Le Mans race in 1966.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Highest Grossing Films of 2019</a></span></p><p>This true story is mesmerizing, but we also can't help but love this star-studded cast. This movie talks a lot about money, but in case you're wondering who the real rich guys are, we've made a list. Here is the cast of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ford v Ferrari</a>,&nbsp;ranked by Net Worth (according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><h2 id=tracy-letts---1-million>Tracy Letts - $1 Million</h2><p>This actor plays Henry Ford II in this race car drama, but he's certainly not new to the big screen. Taking the bottom spot on this list, Tracy Letts's net worth comes from dabbling in both television and film. He was a recurring character in&nbsp;Homeland, The Sinner,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Divorce.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the big screen, you might recognize him from&nbsp;Imperium, The Post, Lady Bird,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Big Short.&nbsp;He's pretty well known for his smaller roles, and he even has one in the new&nbsp;Little Women&nbsp;adaptation as Mr. Dashwood, which will be premiering later in December.</p><h2 id=corrado-invernizzi---3-million>Corrado Invernizzi - $3 Million</h2><p>You'll recognize this man as Franco Gozzi from this flick. This Italian actor has actually been in, well, a lot of Italian movies. He's actually been acting since the late 1990s, and most of his films and television roles are Italian made.</p><p>Still, you might know him from&nbsp;Vincere, Requiem for a Killer,&nbsp;or&nbsp;A Little Lust.&nbsp;It's clear this man is pretty prominent in the Italian industry, and this makes his net worth definitely worthy of a spot on this list.</p><h2 id=caitriona-balfe---4-million>Caitriona Balfe - $4 Million</h2><p>Caitriona plays Bale's adorable wife, but we all know this lovely lady from&nbsp;Outlander,&nbsp;where she plays Claire Randall. It's safe to say most of her dough comes from this show, but she's also been in a handful of other projects. She had a recurring role in&nbsp;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&nbsp;and&nbsp;H+.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Pampered Pets: The Net Worth Of The Cast Of The Secret Life Of Pets</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the big screen, this was her biggest role, but she was also in&nbsp;Money Monster, The Price of Desire,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Escape Plan.&nbsp;Of course, we love and know her best as Claire from the hit medieval drama that wouldn't be the same without her.</p><h2 id=jj-feild---7-million>JJ Feild - $7 Million</h2><p>This actor plays Roy Lunn in this drama, but he's certainly no newbie to acting. He had a recurring role in&nbsp;Turn Up Charlie, New Amsterdam,&nbsp;and&nbsp;TURN: Washington's Spies.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it might surprise you to know that this man was in Captain America, and played James Montgomery Falsworth. He has quite a few credits under his belt, but most are small television roles or side characters in films. Still, $7 million is nothing to cry about, and we're sure he's got more coming.</p><h2 id=jon-bernthal---8-million>Jon Bernthal - $8 Million</h2><p>We all know this handsome face, but you may not have been able to place him. He crushed it as Lee Iacocca, but this role was certainly different than ones he's previously played. That's right, this man is the Punisher (AKA Frank Castle). If that wasn't enough, he was Shane Walsh in&nbsp;The Walking Dead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's also been in quite a few blockbusters, including&nbsp;The Wolf of Wall Street, Fury, Sicario,&nbsp;Wind River,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Baby Driver.&nbsp;We suggest looking at the latter for a hilarious and badass role. Seriously though, we're surprised this net worth isn't higher, but we're sure it'll get there.</p><h2 id=ray-mckinnon---10-million>Ray McKinnon - $10 Million</h2><p>Ray McKinnon is our favorite supporting actor. From&nbsp;Mud, Footloose, The Blindside,&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;The Last Ride,&nbsp;this man is our favorite uncle, coach, and whatever supporting role he's hired to slay. He's also dabbled in television, though, including&nbsp;Mayans M.C., Deadwood&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sons of Anarchy.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Downton Abbey: Cast Members Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>We love this humble and talented man, and he was perfect as Phil Remington in this biography drama. We know we haven't seen the last of him, either.</p><h2 id=josh-lucas---16-million>Josh Lucas - $16 Million</h2><p>Josh Lucas is another actor that's probably had a supporting role in all of our favorite flicks. In fact, he acted alongside Christian Bale way back in 2000 for&nbsp;American Psycho.&nbsp;He has quite a few acting credits, so we'll only name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he's the villain in&nbsp;Ford v Ferrari,&nbsp;you probably also recognize him from&nbsp;Breakthrough, The Lincoln Lawyer,&nbsp;and A Beautiful Mind.&nbsp;This man's face pops up in pretty much everything, and we love his versatility and brilliance, even if we hated his guts in this particular movie.</p><h2 id=joe-williamson---18-million>Joe Williamson - $18 Million</h2><p>This young man plays Don Frey in this movie, but he has quite a few other acting credits to show for. You might recognize this handsome face from&nbsp;In-Lawfully Yours, Please Stand By,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lucy n the Sky.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 12 Craziest Things Christian Bale Has Done For Roles</a></span></p><p>However, he also has quite a lot of one-time roles in television. If you're wracking your brain about where you recognize him from, he was an intern in&nbsp;Grey's Anatomy&nbsp;and appeared in 22 episodes.&nbsp;He's also in a new HBO drama,&nbsp;Here and Now&nbsp;as Malcolm Collins. Clearly, whatever he's doing is working, because he takes the bronze medal on this list.</p><h2 id=christian-bale---80-million>Christian Bale - $80 Million</h2><p>Christian Bale absolutely slayed as Ken Miles, and it's no surprise he takes the silver medal for highest net worth. This actor is definitely our favorite Batman, but he's also been in a ton of critically-acclaimed films. Just to name a few, you should check out&nbsp;The Big Short, American Hustle,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vice.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's an Academy-Award winner with honestly some of the best acting versatility ever seen in the industry. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">From Bruce Wayne to Ken Miles to Patrick Bateman</a>, this man can do it all, and we love this man through and through. Of course, his net worth definitely shows for it.</p><h2 id=matt-damon---170-million>Matt Damon - $170 Million</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Damon</a> is obviously #1 on this list. With a whopping $170 million to show for it, this man's career is an impressive feat. From all the way back in&nbsp;Good Will Hunting&nbsp;and&nbsp;Saving Private Ryan&nbsp;to&nbsp;The Martian&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Departed,&nbsp;this man releases blockbuster after blockbuster.</p><p>Of course, he also produces, so that net worth will only continue to reach ridiculous heights. This man is also an Oscar winner, but we have to say that we absolutely loved him as Caroll Shelby. We could rave about his movies all day, and we're definitely not mad his net worth gives him the #1 spot on this list.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Knives Out: Net Worth Of The Main Cast, Ranked</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8WoqZ1lpmKzpr7RmqmiZZOWwLV5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tiktok-vonviddy-dead-dies-suicide-posting-video-life-struggles.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              TikToker VonViddy Dead By Suicide, Final Video Talked Struggles and A">&larr;
