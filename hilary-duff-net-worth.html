Joel Madden, the singer of the band Good Charlotte, was 25 years old when Duff, then 16, started seeing him in July 2004. The couple’s age difference garnered media attention, and two years later, in November 2006, they split up.</p><p>Mike Comrie, a Canadian NHL player, and Duff started dating in 2007. They were wed between 2010 and 2016. Luca Cruz Comrie, the son of the couple, was born in March 2012. Mike comes from a very prosperous family.
