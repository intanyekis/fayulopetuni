Sure, the actress has starred in quirky films like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. However, her appearances in the remakes of Black Christmas and The Thing, along with her turn in Final Destination 3, are what people most associate her with. Although <a href=#>Winstead said no to a popular teen movie</a>, her resume is pretty packed, and it's fun to see her play final girls and characters in terrifying situations.</p><p>Mary Elizabeth Winstead may be a beloved actress, but she isn't typically the subject of massive media coverage. That all changed in 2017 when she shared that she and Riley Stearns were getting divorced. Since Winstead began dating Ewan McGregor a little while after, fans were intrigued, and there's a lot to know about this whole situation...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-mary-elizabeth-winstead-and-riley-stearns-get-divorced>Why Did Mary Elizabeth Winstead And Riley Stearns Get Divorced?</h2><p><a href=#>Ewan McGregor has a better relationship with his daughters</a> now than he did when he and Mary Elizabeth Winstead first began dating.

While Winstead hasn't explained that this is what happened to her, she and McGregor did meet a year or so before she decided to get divorced from Riley Stearns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mary-elizabeth-winstead-sky-high.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s Unusual Upbringing Made It Hard For Her To Star In This Disney Movie">Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s Unusual Upbringing Made It Hard For Her To Star In This Disney Movie</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Since Mary Elizabeth Winstead had an unusual childhood, she struggled to relate to her character in a popular Disney movie.</p><p>According to People, Winstead and McGregor first met on the set of the TV adaptation of Fargo in 2016. McGregor was also going through a divorce. He and his first wife, Eve Mavrakis, were married from 2005 to 2018.</p><p>While the actors did meet while they were both still married, they didn't become romantically involved until they knew that their respective relationships were finished. There was definitely no overlap. It must have been an emotional time for both actors, though.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mary-elizabeth-winstead-riley-stearns.jpg><p>Winstead and Stearns were married from 2010 to 2017. Stearns is a movie director who was behind the camera on three movies: 2014's Faults, 2019's The Art of Self-Defense, and 2022's Dual.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2017, Mary Elizabeth Winstead posted a photo of herself and Riley Stearns on Instagram and explained that they had decided to get divorced.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ewan-mcgregor-severely-complicated-mary-elizabeth-winstead-s-divorce-from-her-first-husband-riley-stearns.jpg><p>She wrote, "Sitting here with my best friend who I love with all my heart. We have spent our lives together and it has been full of joy and warmth every day. We've decided to move on from our marriage, but we will stay best friends and collaborators for all our days. We are still ride or die, just in a different way now. I love you always, Riley."</p><h2 id=what-did-mary-elizabeth-winstead-and-riley-stearns-say-about-their-divorce>What Did Mary Elizabeth Winstead And Riley Stearns Say About Their Divorce?</h2><p>After Mary Elizabeth Winstead posted on Instagram about her divorce, Riley Stearns shared a similar message. It sounded like the former pair was on good terms and were going to remain friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, according to The Daily Mail, Riley Stearns reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted about Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead</a> on Instagram. The Daily Mail reported that Stearns wrote, "Laugh at me, will ya? F**k the woman of my dreams behind my back, will ya? @mewins @mscregor_ewan You're F***ING dead..."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/riley-stearns.jpg><p>If this Instagram post did exist, it's no longer searchable.

However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winstead talked about her divorce</a> in an interview with Glamour UK in 2020 and was honest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mary-elizabeth-winstead.jpg><p>The actress said, "I got divorced a couple of years ago, which was a scary, crazy thing for me because I had been with the same person since I was 18 years old, and that was what I knew. All the way through my twenties I was trying very hard to keep myself the same, because another thing I heard a lot growing up was people saying, “you’re so great, never change”. You can take that to heart, in the wrong way, and try to keep yourself from growing too much because you don’t know what’s on the other side."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/47925ED7-54B9-46D3-869F-DDC0D41A6580.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="'Birds Of Prey': What Is Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Net Worth?">'Birds Of Prey': What Is Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Net Worth?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s net worth looks as though it has a good chance of going up in no time.</p><p>It seems like things between Winstead and Stearns calmed down, as there were no further reports of Stearns possibly writing on social media about his ex-wife and her new partner.</p><h2 id=what-is-mary-elizabeth-winstead-and-ewan-mcgregor-39-s-relationship-like>What Is Mary Elizabeth Winstead And Ewan McGregor's Relationship Like?</h2><p>In June 2021, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ewan McGregor became parents to their baby boy Laurie. In April 2022, according to People, the couple got married. Although they began dating several years before, they did wait a little while before making things official.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mary-elizabeth-winstead-1.jpg><p>It sounds like both actors are glad about the way that things have worked out. In November 2019, McGregor was on the cover of Men's Journal and he talked about being with Winstead. He said, “Lighter? Today? As opposed to then? I am better. I am happier. I think that’s true.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the last couple of years, Mary Elizabeth Winstead doesn't seem to have said much about Ewan McGregor. It's possible that she wants to maintain some privacy since her divorce from Riley Stearns was very public.</p><p>Winstead is also busy as a mom to a young child, and it sounds like she and McGregor are having fun sharing their Hollywood careers with their child. In September 2023, she told Entertainment Weekly that her son loves Star Wars, which is cool since she was cast in Ahoska.</p><p>Winstead said of her son, "He's got Star Wars friends all over the place — like Grogu dolls everywhere that he's obsessed with. It's been a part of our lives for a while now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsJmeYrqks9GenqiqXaKus8WMnqOispGXsrW0jLCgp6ukmq6lv4yfoKurpGK1tr%2FBmqWdZaKeuabFjKyrnpmio8BusMivpqublWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gabriel-brownlow-dindy-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-172558-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gabriel Brownlow-Dindy Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biogr">&larr;
