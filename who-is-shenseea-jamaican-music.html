Shenseea is now one of the biggest names in Jamaican music but not so long ago, she was working as a promo girl at parties in Jamaica.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was then signed to Lemuel Samuel's Rockstar, and later gained popularity after remixing a song by one of Jamaica’s most prolific Dancehall artists. In just a couple years, Shenseea has gone from being a party promo girl to performing on the biggest stages in Jamaica. She has already conquered some big stages here in the US including Rolling Loud; this year on her quest to become a global superstar she will be making her Coachella debut.</p><p>Shenseea is making waves in the music industry, but what else is there to know about her? Read on for some more interesting details about the international star.</p><h2 id=shenseea-rsquo-s-career-started-on-a-controversial-note><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Shenseea’s Career Started On A Controversial Note</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shenseea.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Dancehall star rose to fame after she released her debut single “Loodi” (2017), originally recorded by Vybz Kartel, but was remixed by the <a href=# rel=nofollow>“Lick”</a> singer. Her big break however did not come without some controversy, as she was called out by the incarcerated deejay along with her manager Romeich Major. In addition to not properly mentioning him as the man who gave Shenseea her breakthrough hit, Vybz Kartel claimed that Shenseea's management team did not properly clear the song for use, nor did they offer proper compensation.</p><p>In what seemed like a strategic move on Vybz Kartel’s part the solo version of the track was uploaded to Youtube without the consent of his label, VP Records. However, it was removed from the platform after being up for one day, and sources close to Vybz Kartel later revealed that the artist had nothing to do with the unauthorized upload. A series of interviews with Romiech and producer Elvis Redwood from So Unique Records ultimately put an end to the matter, as both men confirmed that payment was made to Vybz Kartel and his earlier claims of ignorance were disproved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shenseea-has-collaborated-with-some-big-names><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Shenseea Has Collaborated With Some Big Names</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shenseea-1.png><p>Her debut single was released in 2017; fast-forward six years later, Shenseea has already collaborated with a list of heavy hitters in the music industry that could be the envy of some that have been in the industry way longer than she has been.</p><p>Before she even signed a recording deal with Interscope, Shenseea was featured on Christina Aguilera's 2018 album Liberation, on the song "Right Moves", since signing with the record label in 2019, she’s released the HipHop/Dancehall track “Blessed” featuring Tyga. She’s also collaborated with Jamaican record producer Rvssian on a single titled "IDKW" in 2020, which also featured Swae Lee and Young Thug. That same year, Shenseea appeared on Masego's album Studying Abroad, and Major Lazer's Music is the Weapon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Happened Between Lady Gaga And Christina Aguilera?</a></span></p><h2 id=why-shenseea-was-nominated-at-the-2022-grammy-awards><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Why Shenseea Was Nominated At The 2022 Grammy Awards</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shenseea-dressed-up-for-the-vmas-2022.png><p>In 2021, Shenseea collaborated with Kanye West on his album Donda, appearing on two songs "Pure Souls" along with Roddy Rich and "Ok Ok Pt 2" which also features Rooga. She ended up performing with Kanye West at his Chicago Donda event.</p><p>As a featured artist on West's album, Shenseea was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2022 Grammy Awards, marking her first Grammy nomination. Also in 2021, Shenseea signed with Wassim "Sal" Slaiby, aka Salxo, who manages a roster of A-listers including the Weeknd and Doja Cat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Has Kim Kardashian Let Her Kids Meet Kanye West’s New Wife?</a></span></p><h2 id=who-else-has-shenseea-worked-with><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Who Else Has Shenseea Worked With?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Megan-Thee-Stallion-And-Shenseea-Reveal-Single-Lick-NSFW-Music-Video.jpg><p>Last January, Shenseea released the song "Lick", featuring Megan Thee Stallion. Despite all the media attention the song received due to its explicit material, the song failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100. It managed to reach No. 20 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. Shortly after the release of the song, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shenseea and Interscope was hit with a $10 million lawsuit</a> for copyright infringement over the use of elements of Denise Belfon’s 1999 popular Soca song “Work”. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shenseea was hit with a second lawsuit in 2022</a>, this time by Stephanie Sarley, a California-based visual artist known for her Instagram “fruit art videos”. Sarley alleged that Shenseea’s original “Foreplay” music video (which has since been removed from YouTube), had incorporated “nearly forty seconds of footage” from her “unique line of sensual fruit imagery,” which were “sometimes altered slightly in tone or hue.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of Shenseea’s latest collaborations is on Calvin Harris’ hit song “Obsessed” which also features Charlie Puth. The Calvin Harris promotional single, which was released in the latter half of 2022 managed to peak at No. 71 on the UK Singles Chart.</p><h2 id=does-prince-harry-really-listen-to-shenseea><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Does Prince Harry Really Listen To Shenseea?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shenseea-1.jpg><p>An alleged leaked excerpt from <a href=# rel=nofollow>Prince Harry's memoir Spare</a>, revealed that Shenseea's music helped him through a dark time with his family, as reported by The Jasmine Brand. The excerpt reportedly reads, “in the times I felt alone and separated from my family, I always took time to myself to sit back and listen to Shenseea. Her lyrics resonated with me and got me through a lot.” The Danchall star caught wind of a viral tweet containing Prince Harry’s alleged words and responded with a tweet of her own, “I know Rebel is his song!

A photo of them walking hand in hand after the event proved it was them, and Shenseea later claimed he was just trying to save her from falling in her heels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shenseea-faced-more-controversy-in-2022-this-time-in-her-love-life><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Shenseea Faced More Controversy In 2022, This Time In Her Love Life</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shenseea-and-her-son-rajeiro-lee.png><p>Later in 2022, Shenseea was at the center of a scandal involving London as a woman named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Eboni Ivory with whom the producer has a daughter, took to social media with some words for Shenseea</a>. Eboni sent a warning to Shenseea to take her 7-year-old son to therapy for allegedly doing something to her daughter. In one of her stories she wrote “I’m saying loud and clear, and I mean it from the bottom of my soul. Shenseea, you and your little nasty son stay away from my daughter.” And in another she continued “Shenseea, you need to talk to your son and take him to therapy before he grows up and gets into real trouble.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eboni seemingly confirmed that Shenseea and London On Da Track were in fact together as she wrote in a follow-up story, “You been playing on my top from the jump trying to make Paris call you mom like a weirdo.
