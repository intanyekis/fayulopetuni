Besides her hair, I was struck by how beautiful her face and facial profile are.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p>I’m hoping that issue is a part of her character’s current situation. Liz is beautiful and her hair was always pretty and in place. It’s been looking interesting these past few months. I’m baffled.</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p>Yes, it looked like she stuck her fingers into a light socket.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Evie7</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>October 8, 2022, 10:41pm <span itemprop=position>5</span></span><p>I didn’t like it either.

I’m just rolling my eyes that someone thought that was an evening/club look🙄 It’s more like they left the curlers in too long and used way too much hair spray.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I have noticed her hair has been having issues for a long time now. Its looks almost like a bad wig. She used to have amazing hair and I am not sure if the actress is having some problems like Kirsten has physically but you would think they would try a little more.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>It looks like she cut a few inches off it and is just trying different things, sometimes we do that and regret it. I liked her hair better the way it was before. It looks like the stylists on the GH set are teasing it and putting a lot of hairspray in it. It was much prettier before and more shiny and bouncy.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>What is going on with Elizabeth period? I just dont understand what this SL is all about. Is she ok now? I FF through her scenes which saddens me besuse she is one of my favs on the show., but half the time I dont watch because I have no idea what her problem is. I love her with her boys though. She is a good mother.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>It looks like she’s being portrayed as having a mental breakdown. She did lose her husband, and all these memories now are coming to the surface that it looks like she’s starting to break.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I thought I was the only one who thought it looked like a wig. That was a few weeks back and I was going to ask if anyone else thought so.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Oh really? I’ll look again, but to me it just looks all teased and sprayed like the old days.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>DogByte</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>October 10, 2022, 3:28pm <span itemprop=position>14</span></span><p><a class=mention href=#>@Horseopera</a> ~~ Happy Cakeday! <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/champagne.png title=:champagne: alt=:champagne: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>What I’ve noticed is that when Liz is really having a bad day, she does wear a ratty wig. Seems to be a prop going to her state of mind. On less stressful days she’s wearing her own hair. Much sleeker and smoother.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>The hairstyle I’m referring to was smooth, but looked almost too perfect like a wig would, but maybe you’re right and I’m sure she colors it.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>The sleeker and smooth style was the one that I thought might actually be the wig as it looked too perfect.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Right?
