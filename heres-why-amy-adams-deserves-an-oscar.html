Despite receiving 6 Academy Award nominations, she has yet to receive an Oscar.&nbsp;She played candy striper nurse Brenda in the 2002 chase comedy Catch Me If You Can. Director Steven Spielberg praised her in a 2008 interview and <a href=#>said</a>, "That was the part that should have launched her career."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For her role as Ashley Johnsten in&nbsp;Junebug,&nbsp;she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. While she didn't win the award, she took home the Special Jury Prize for Acting from the Sundance Film Festival in 2005. She also won an Independent Spirit Award for her role.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 15 Best Rom-Coms on Hulu Right Now</a></span></p><p>Adams then starred as the highly enthusiastic Disney princess, Giselle in the musical romantic comedy Enchanted. She was among 250 actresses who auditioned for the part. But the director Kevin Lima insisted on Adams because of her commitment and ability to&nbsp;stay objective in regard to&nbsp;Giselle's personality. She sang three songs for the film's soundtrack, True Love's Kiss, Happy Working Song and That's How You Know. Film critic Roger Ebert praised Adams for her role, he <a href=#>said</a>, "You should have seen Junebug by now, which means you will not be surprised by how fresh and winning Amy Adams is in Enchanted, where her role absolutely depends on effortless lovability. She's so lovable, in fact, she starts life as an animated princess in a Disney-style world. The birds, flowers, chipmunks and cockroaches even love her and do her bidding."Adams was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for&nbsp;Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She received a second Oscar nomination for Doubt,&nbsp;for&nbsp;her 2008 role as the nun Sister James, opposite Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.

Director John Patrick Shanley <a href=#>raved </a>about her, he said, "She's wonderful to watch but also full of wonder. She has an extremely demonstrative face, and when you look into her eyes, there's a wonder that's there and a receptivity to what's going on around her. She's a door into another world, and it's a sort of magical world." Adams talked about what it was like working with Streep and Hoffman, she <a href=#>said</a>, "It's like going to a master class for three weeks. I just often think, How amazing it is that I just get to be here and watch these guys work? But they are lovely and in no way intentionally intimidating. Any intimidation I felt was purely in my own head."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Movies We Never Expected to Cry During</a></span></p><p>In 2010, she starred in the David O.
