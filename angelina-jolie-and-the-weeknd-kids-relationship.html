Keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=did-angelina-jolie-39-s-kids-meet-the-weeknd>Did Angelina Jolie's Kids Meet The Weeknd?</h2><p>Only two weeks after news broke of Angelina Jolie and The Weeknd's alleged relationship, the Hollywood star's children reportedly met the famous singer. In July 2021, Hollywood Life reported that Jolie's daughters Shiloh and Zahara attended poet Mustafa’s private show in Los Angeles alongside their mother and The Weeknd. However, the two stars were not photographed together even though they both attended the event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two stars were first spotted together when they went to dinner together at Giorgio Baldi, a popular restaurant in Santa Monica, California.

"They’re clearly not trying to hide [the dinner date]," the insider revealed. "He’s definitely focused on getting to the movie business. He has the new HBO series he’s starring in." The Weeknd is starring in HBO's upcoming drama show The Idol which is created by Euphoria creator Sam Levinson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, according to US Weekly, the two stars weren't on a romantic date but rather on a business dinner. "Angelina and The Weeknd had a business meeting," a source for the outlet said. "It had to do with their HBO shows. They got along great, but there is nothing romantic happening between the two of them."</p><h2 id=why-don-39-t-angelina-jolie-39-s-kids-like-the-weeknd>Why Don't Angelina Jolie's Kids Like The Weeknd?</h2><p>While Angelina Jolie's children don't seem to have anything against The Weeknd, reports claim that they prefer Jolie's ex-husband Jonny Lee Miller whom the actress was linked to in June 2021. Jolie was married to Miller from 1996 to 1999, and more than 20 years later she was photographed arriving at the actor's apartment in Brooklyn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Sun, Angelina Jolie <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told her children that Jonny Lee Miller is her "first love."</a> According to an insider for the outlet, the actress even introduced the actor to one of her youngest children, Knox. "On her first evening with Jonny, Angelina only took Knox along, and they got on like a house on fire," the source revealed. "Knox is a sweet kid, and I imagine she decided he was the easiest one to begin introductions with. [Jonny is a] guy she’s always spoken so fondly about. They only hung out for a short while at Jonny’s apartment, but they seemed to get along well."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Rumors Buzz About Angelina Jolie Using The Weeknd To Remain Current">Rumors Buzz About Angelina Jolie Using The Weeknd To Remain Current</a></span></p><p>According to National Enquirer, Jolie has been linked to both Miller and The Weeknd.

"Angie doesn’t seem bothered by the song, but the kids aren’t exactly warming to Abel. They can’t make him go away, but they don’t have to like it. They like Jonny better.

He’s really discreet," the source said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while some outlets report that Jolie's kids are not fans of The Weeknd, others claim they are thrilled that their mother has connections to the famous singer.
