After all, the two hugely successful and completely gorgeous stars have been seen passionately embracing in the past. As Shakira would later reveal to Elle in 2022, however, the truth about their relationship and what led to their split is a lot less idyllic.</p><p>According to what she said during that interview, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakira sacrificed her career</a></strong> so Piqué could focus on his career.</p><p>"I mean, one of the two of us had to make a sacrifice, right? Either he would stop his contract with Barcelona and move to the U.S. with me, where my career is, or I would have to do that instead. And so, one of the two had to make that effort and that sacrifice. And I did it. I put my career in second gear and I came to Spain, to support him so he could play football and win titles."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1-4.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Shakira told Elle that giving up her career was a "sacrifice of love", it seems to have become an issue in their relationship. After all, Shakira referenced the situation in the lyrics to her 2022 song “Te Felicito”. When quoting the lyrics to “Te Felicito” in this article, they are translated from Spanish to English.</p><p>“To make you whole. I broke myself in pieces. I was warned, but I didn’t take heed."</p><p>Immediately from there, the lyrics to “Te Felicito” seemingly refer to dishonesty on Piqué's behalf. "Don’t tell me you’re sorry. I know you well and I know you’re lying.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/your-paragraph-text-2024-03-24t091555-197.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='Shakira&#39;s Decision Not To Get Surgery During The "Darkest Moment" Of Her Life Saved Her Career'>Shakira's Decision Not To Get Surgery During The "Darkest Moment" Of Her Life Saved Her Career</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Shakira almost lost her voice due to a vocal cord hemorrhage in 2017.</p><p>During the aforementioned Elle interview, the outlet's reporter asked Shakira if the lyrics to her song were referring to how she put her career on the backburner.

As the story goes, Shakira discovered a partially consumed jar of strawberry jam in the family fridge. Realizing that nobody in their family likes strawberry jam, Shakira figured out Piqué had another woman in the house they shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Shakira and Gerard Piqué split up, she has been the subject of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several romantic rumors</a> .

Though I still think experiencing love, fully experiencing it with all its peaks and valleys, it's so essential to the human life. I love love, but I think I even love friendship a little bit more."</p><p>Shakira went on to hint at how disappointed she was that her last romance led to a breakup.

As Shakira explained, going through the hardest time in her life taught her how much having good friends can mean.</p><p>"I wasn't one of those people who valued friendship as much. I've always valued family and having a partner in a couple. I've always been in a couple. But then when that wasn't there, and when I lost my boys and when I had to face the darkest and the hardest moments of my life, friends were there and they kept me together."</p><p>Shakira continued, "Those who did really showed me the true, the true meaning of life. I might not grow old with a partner, but I will grow old surrounded by good friends."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoZmbnr%2BiecSxZKCdopa%2FpXnPoqiunaNiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxedKpo6KsXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thomas-schmidheiny-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Thomas Schmidheiny Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
