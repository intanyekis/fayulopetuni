Matthew McConaughey’s wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">also known as Camila Alves</a>, is a stunning woman who’s been around for quite a while. Not only does she have an incredible amount of physical beauty, but we discovered that she’s also got a whole lot of business savvy...not to mention some&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slick motherhood tricks everyone loves</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alves is absolutely incredible and we’re surprised she doesn’t come up in conversation more often.</p><p>From their hilarious beginnings in a club (McConaughey was undercover) to where she’s at now with entrepreneurship and kids, we’ve gone through and found all the best facts about Camila Alves. Trust us, there’s nobody out there who comes close to all the incredible things she does! (well,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">okay, maybe Beyonce.</a>)</p><h2 id=well-firstly-she-s-a-model><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Well, Firstly, She’s A Model</span></h2><p>Or, rather, she was. We don’t know if she’s doing much in the way of modeling now, but it was one of the main things that she came to the U.S. for. Her portfolio was strong, and she is always ready to jump in front of a camera. However, it seems like she’s refocused her passion into entrepreneurship; that takes the same amount of grit and hustle that modeling does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-and-matthew-met-in-the-most-awkward-way><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She And Matthew Met In The Most Awkward Way</span></h2><p>This woman literally blew into Matthew McConaughey’s life and swept him up in a whirlwind.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it wasn’t reciprocated</a>. While Matthew might have been invested from the get-go, Camila Alves certainly was not. According to Matthew, it took a whole lot of convincing to get her to go for it! He had to fight pretty hard to impress her. She just didn’t know who he was at first!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Is Matthew McConaugheys Greatest Improvised Line Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=she-had-quite-the-life-beforehand><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Had Quite The Life Beforehand</span></h2><p>Maybe that’s because she was so busy living her own life down in Brazil - news of Matthew McConaughey never quite reached her. What a life she was living! It was really the opposite in a lot of ways of the life she's living now. Celebrity wasn’t on her mind when she was young, but she was destined to be well-known.</p><h2 id=and-she-s-no-stranger-to-hard-work><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>And She’s No Stranger To Hard Work</span></h2><p>When she did move to America, she was quite young. She's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">looked back at that time</a>, saying: "growing up, I had to make my own way… It was not like I'm going to call Dad to pay the bills. That wasn't part of the equation. I had to figure it out...I know how to take care of a house, so I started cleaning houses."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-runs-several-successful-businesses-now><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>And Runs Several Successful Businesses Now</span></h2><p>Between helping charitable organizations and her all-natural organic baby food company, she’s got a lot on her plate already. However, these aren’t her only business endeavors. She and her mom also have a business together; one that fulfills every woman’s desire for a handbag that can stand up to the rigors of everyday life.</p><h2 id=she-s-got-great-morals><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She’s Got Great Morals</span></h2><p>One of the big things we should all look for in a partner is a strong moral code. “The main thing is that my wife and I, Camila, we have a similar moral bottom line. And as you learn, if you have kids, every day they get older, you realize how much more it’s really DNA”, according to People.</p><p>If you and your partner aren’t compatible morally, you’re probably going to run into some issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-a-rational-personality><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>And A Rational Personality</span></h2><p>One of the big things we admire about Camila is her rational personality. She explains that “real drama will come. That's inevitable. It's going to happen. ... Problems are going to happen; they're out of our control, and that will be real drama. But the things that you do have control over, don't make them a big deal. I don't see myself as being a Zen person. I see myself as being adaptable”, according to Daily Mail, which is how she’s managed to survive and thrive!</p><h2 id=she-s-made-her-own-home><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She’s Made Her Own Home</span></h2><p>Home can be a point of contention for many of us who grew up in more than one place. Camila Alves moved from Brazil when she was still a teenager. She says, “even though I was born and raised in Brazil, my family is still there, and that's my home country — if you ask me, 'Where is your home?' I would say it's here...It's Texas, and I take pride in that.” She knows that home is where the heart is, and where you’ve set down your roots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-knows-herself-according-to-matthew><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Knows Herself (According To Matthew)</span></h2><p>The way the story goes is actually kind of sweet. McConaughey hit on Camila Alves a few times, and while she was hesitant at first, she did go home with him...but only to sleep in his guest bedroom! Matthew was convinced then and there that she was the one because it was proof that she knew herself and was strong in terms of self-respect.</p><h2 id=they-know-how-to-keep-their-love-alive><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Know How To Keep Their Love Alive</span></h2><p>One of the things that Camila Alves seems to be pretty good at is figuring out how to keep their romance alive (even during lockdown). While she might have been hesitant to start things off with McConaughey, she’s certainly pushing to keep them strong. “[We do] a lot of staying at home, cooking together or getting a hotel room that is 10 minutes away from the house,” proving that you don’t need any big, grand gestures to keep love blossoming.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12 Most Romantic Celeb Relationships We Swooned Over +8 That Were Total Bummers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-how-to-keep-everyone-healthy><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>And How To Keep Everyone Healthy</span></h2><p>One of her business ventures is Yummy Spoonfuls. We’ve touched on it briefly before, but it’s worth diving into. Yummy Spoonfuls grew because “when [she] became a mother for the first time, it became even more clear that changes needed to be made in the baby food industry — especially for the most important beings in the world.” Organic, natural foods are the name of her game, keeping everyone healthy from day one.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Is Divided Over Whether Coleslaw Is Actually Healthy Or Not</a></span></p><h2 id=she-s-gorgeous-inside-and-out><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She’s Gorgeous, Inside And Out</span></h2><p>All in all, she’s just a gorgeous woman. Not only is she a fantastic mother, but she’s also managed to craft a business savvy that’s second to none. Her relationship is strong and (let’s be real) she still looks like a supermodel, a decade down the line. Is she the most perfect person in the world? We certainly think so.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Celebrity Couples With Disturbing Age Gaps</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuucCtq6Gdp2K6pK%2FOp5iun5iaxrR51qKdnmWTlrqquMBmmKWulah8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./10-most-interesting-animals-to-break-a-guinness-world-record.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Most Interesting Animals To Break A Guinness World Record">&larr;
