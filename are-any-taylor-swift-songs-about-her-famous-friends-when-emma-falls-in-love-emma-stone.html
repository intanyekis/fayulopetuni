Since the beloved singer has fallen for many people in her life, it's only natural that she would write songs about her feelings surrounding various breakups. Fans think that "Dear John" is about John Mayer and "All Too Well" depicts the singer's time with Jake Gyllenhaal. But some of Swift's other tunes seem to be about topics other than romantic love.</p><p>Taylor Swift and <a href=#>Crazy Stupid Love star Emma Stone</a> have been friends for a while. And when Swift released "Speak Now (Taylor's Version)" in July 2023, the song "When Emma Falls In Love" stood out and people wondered if it referred to Emma Stone. Taylor Swift has many famous pals, including Blake Lively and Selena Gomez. Did she pen any of her beloved songs about these friendships?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-write-quot-when-emma-falls-in-love-quot-for-emma-stone>Did Taylor Swift Write "When Emma Falls In Love" For Emma Stone?</h2><p>As soon as fans heard "When Emma Falls In Love," a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumor started that she wrote it for Emma Stone</a>.</p><p>According to Entertainment Weekly, there are a few reasons why this could be the case. When Emma Stone starred in the movie Easy A, there's a moment when she sings the song "Pocketful of Sunshine" by Natasha Bedingfield. Swift wrote the lyrics "little miss sunshine," which could refer to this part of the film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-5-1.jpg><p>EW also mentioned that Stone and her mom get along really well, and Swift wrote about someone named Emma talking to her mom on the phone after she began to date someone who she really cared about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's 10 Most Popular Songs (According To Spotify)</a></span></p><p>Taylor Swift hasn't confirmed that she was thinking of Emma Stone when she wrote the song "When Emma Falls In Love." But as her fans know, she doesn't usually confirm the meaning of her songs. She seems to be fine with her fanbase constantly wondering who she's singing about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-2.jpg><p>Unless the singer has a good friend named Emma who isn't famous, it seems fair to assume that she wrote this song about the actress.</p><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-write-any-songs-about-her-celebrity-friends>Did Taylor Swift Write Any Songs About Her Celebrity Friends?</h2><p>While Taylor Swift hasn't said that any of her songs are about her famous friends, some of her most popular songs are definitely about friendship. That includes "It's Nice To Have A Friend" from her 2019 album "Lover" and "22" from her 2012 album "Red."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-swift-s-tours-have-been-outrageous-and-filled-with-controversies-the-truth-about-what-really-happened-behind-the-scenes.jpg><p>"It's Nice To Have A Friend" tells a sweet story of spending time with a pal. The lyrics talk about walking home from school together, playing video games, and chatting. Taylor sings about finding someone who she can confide in: "Light pink sky up on the roof/Sun sinks down, no curfew/Twenty questions, we tell the truth/You've been stressed out lately? Yeah, me too."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Taylor Swift Snubbing Fans By Setting High Ticket Prices?</a></span></p><p>"22" is a super popular single from "Red" and the lyrics depict a night spent with good pals, dancing and not caring about anything. Lyrics like "It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters/And make fun of our exes" and "It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight" are memorable and sweet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-1-2.jpg><p>It's possible to think that Taylor Swift has spent many such nights with friends like Selena Gomez. It seems that they have found a special bond. And they can likely appreciate the fact that they're both equally famous singers who have experienced similar things while living in the limelight.</p><p>In 2012, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift talked about her "Red" album</a> in an interview with Billboard. She said that she enjoyed being 22 years old and that she wanted to write about that time in her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift said, "For me, being 22 has been my favorite year of my life. I like all the possibilities of how you’re still learning, but you know enough. You still know nothing, but you know that you know nothing. You’re old enough to start planning your life, but you’re young enough to know there are so many unanswered questions. That brings about a carefree feeling that is sort of based on indecision and fear and a the same time letting lose. Being 22 has taught me so much."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dianna-agron-may-not-have-dated-taylor-swift-but-here-s-everything-we-know-about-her-relationship-with-harold-ancart.jpg><p>In 2023, Swift's friend Dianna Agron was interviewed by Rolling Stone about "22." When asked if Swift wrote "22" because of their bond, Agron said that she couldn't confirm that, but the song was definitely about Swift's social circle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Agron told Rolling Stone, “Me? Oh, if only! That’s more because of a friendship than being the inspiration for the song. But I would not be the person to ask about that. I cannot claim that!”</p><p>"It's Nice To Have A Friend" and "22" prove that Taylor Swift writes songs that her fans can relate to, no matter what the subject. And everyone knows that great feeling of finally meeting someone who truly gets it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift May Have Shaded Elon Musk, And He Wasn't Happy About It</a></span></p><p>In 2019, the singer was interviewed by Billboard and said that she wrote "It's Nice To Have A Friend" about a special platonic relationship. She said, “But at the end of the day we’ve been searching for that since we were kids! When you had a friend when you were nine years old, and that friend was all you talked about, and you wanted to have sleepovers and you wanted to walk down the street together and sit there drawing pictures together or be silent together, or be talking all night. We’re just looking for that, but endless sparks, as adults.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52757069-1.jpg><p>Hopefully Taylor Swift will write more songs about friends when she puts out her next few albums. "It's Nice To Have A Friend" is more emotional than "22," but both songs prove that she has a real knack for writing about this subject.</p><p>Swift seems to have many close friends who really understand her. And it's clear that she appreciates them all. No matter who some of these tunes are about, Swift definitely knows how to craft a great song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dlru6edOasKWnomLAuLXFrWSsp56cwG6twaisrWWYmr9ussCmpq6rXZu%2FqrHNnapmr5iau26xzKaYZp6Robm0ecinZKWnppp6prnMmmSsrJ%2BjsnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bachelor-alum-teddi-wright-engaged-to-boyfriend-nicholas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bachelor Alum Teddi Wright Engaged to Boyfriend Nicholas!">&larr;
