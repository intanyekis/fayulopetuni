It has almost become impossible to live up to society's high demands when it comes to the way women look. Instagram, magazines, television and movies are all reminders that women are supposed to have perfect faces being held up by perfect bodies.</p><p>This is something that is becoming more and more common and even the most beautiful women in the world have had work done. In show business, there is even more pressure put on women to look a certain way, which is why so many of them decide to turn to plastic surgery. From Botox to lip injections, adjusted boobs and breasts or nose jobs, celebrities are far from strangers to the world of cosmetic surgeries.</p><p>However, many celebrities try to deny having work done, which is why we at TheRichest thought it would be a fun idea to come up with a list of super hot celebrities who have obviously had work done, but who deny ever doing it. Some of the women on this list may surprise you, and even the ones who won't, will still leave you entertained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These are fifteen gorgeous female celebrities who deny their obvious plastic surgery. C'mon ladies, if you are going to do it, you should own it!</p><h2 id=15-blake-lively><strong>15. Blake Lively</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively</a> is stunning, no doubt about that. The mother and wife to hunk <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Reynolds</a> has always been a beautiful girl. Lively made her big screen debut in 2005 in the film The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants, but she is probably best known for her role on the hit television series Gossip Girl. She has also appeared in films such as Savages, The Age of Adalaine, and All I See is You. Throughout the years, fans have watched her evolve as an actress and a person, however, one thing that we have noticed is that she has had some work done! Lively, has never come out and admitted that she has undergone plastic surgery, but it does not take an expert to notice that she changed both her nose and the size of her breasts. The small change made a huge difference, and even if she won't admit it,&nbsp;we at TheRichest must admit that she does look better now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-jennifer-farley><strong>14. Jennifer Farley&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Most of you don't know her by the name <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Farley</a>, but we are almost certain all of you know her as&nbsp;JWoww from the show Jersey Shore. Jwoww who had gotten her breasts done before the show&nbsp;denies getting any work done on her face. JWoww has also gotten a boob job after the show, switching in some 34F boobs that she said were inspired by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carmen Electra</a>, as well as being necessary after giving birth.</p><p>For a while there were countless accusations being made towards the reality star, claiming that she had facelifts and several Botox sessions.&nbsp;The world would believe her about the other surgeries if she did not look so different.&nbsp;Farley has yet to come clean about going under the knife for anything other than her breasts, claiming that her makeup artist is just very good. Although we are not buying what she is selling, Farley is sticking with her lie and refusing to fess up about the rumors.</p><h2 id=13-nene-leakes><strong>13. NeNe Leakes</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NeNe Leakes</a> is known for being one of the most outspoken and controversial reality stars. The beautiful Leakes made herself into a brand after she appeared on The Real Housewives of Atlanta. It is easy to see why she has an enormous fan base with&nbsp;her badass attitude in combination with her savvy business mindset.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout her years in the public eye, Leakes has admitted to getting some cosmetic surgeries, including a nose job. However, this year, there were rumors going around that her weight loss was the result of surgery. Leakes came back to the public with her entire diet and exercise plan in an&nbsp;attempt to stop the rumors. However, believe her or not, we at TheRichest think that she may have had some fat surgically removed from her body. Either way, she is looking healthier, but the truth will most likely never be revealed.</p><h2 id=12-janet-jackson><strong>12. Janet Jackson</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Janet Jackson</a> has been in the public eye for pretty much her entire life. The singer, who is one of the most incredible performers in the industry is no stranger to plastic surgery. Throughout the years she has gotten many parts of her body done including her nose. However, when rumors began to spread that she had gotten a facelift, the singer automatically became defensive, which is weird because she has always been known for changing her appearance. Jackson's facelift rumors began in 2014 and she still has not admitted to having that surgery performed on her.&nbsp;Her makeup artist went public saying “Everyone's talking about the brow and how it's going up, and people are calling it a facelift, not true at all - just me. It is the make-up... make-up is made to transform people.” We are not sure if we believe him or not, something tells us that Jackson just does not want people to notice that she is getting older.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-olsen-twins><strong>11. Olsen Twins</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Olsen Twins</a>&nbsp;are '90s icons. The twins have been famous their entire lives, literally. As babies and all throughout their infancy, the Olsen twins played Michelle Tanner on the awesome television show Full House. As the years passed, their brand and empire grew, turning themselves into some of the most successful women in the world. The Olsen twins have always been identical, that is until they discovered the magic of plastic surgery. Although both sisters deny ever having any work done, it is very obvious. From lip injections, to Botox, to nose jobs, these identical twins are no longer that identical. While both Mary-Kate and Ashley are rumoured to have had work done, Mary- Kate has obviously done a lot more to change her face.</p><h2 id=10-jennifer-lopez><strong>10. Jennifer Lopez</strong></h2><p>When it comes to being beautiful, talented and adored, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez</a> aka J-Lo, has all of those categories covered. The bombshell has always been known as one of Hollywood's sexiest women. She has had quite an impressive career also, whether it is releasing hit after hit in the musical world, or appearing in box office hits like Enough, The Wedding Planner and Maid in Manhattan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she is one of the most naturally beautiful women on the planet, Lopez has undergone some cosmetic surgeries throughout her lifetime. In 2013, a surgeon came out claiming that her face shows signs of having work done, J-Lo retaliated claiming she has never had&nbsp;plastic surgery. We at TheRichest want to believe Lopez, however, before and after photos show slight changes in her nose, her breasts and her cheeks and lips.</p><h2 id=9-kate-bosworth><strong>9. Kate Bosworth</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Bosworth</a> is a beautiful actress who has appeared in films like Blue Crush and Win a Date With Tad Hamilton. Bosworth is married to Micheal Polish and has had many accusations made in regards to her appearance. Bosworth also experienced a dramatic weight loss a few years ago and was rumoured to have an eating disorder. Her scary skinny appearance made it almost hard to look at her, but since then she has managed to pack on a couple pounds. The other rumor that has circled the celebrity was that she had plastic surgery. Her lips and nose are noticeably different if you compare her before and after photos, and although it is an obvious difference Bosworth denies allegations of having any plastic surgery at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-coco-austin><strong>8. Coco Austin</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coco Austin</a> is a bombshell who is best known for two things: being married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ice T</a> and having crazy, kick-ass curves. Austin, who has been with Ice T since 2002 has a big booty and even bigger breasts. The rap WAG both admitted to having surgery and denied it. She admitted to having her breasts done when she was a teenager and that is about it. She claims that her gigantic booty is 100% real, however, we at TheRichest have a hard time believing that. Looking at photos of Austin from years ago show how much her behind has grown throughout the years. Although it is possible that she has not had any work done, we are pretty sure that it's a lie. One thing is clear, whatever she has done, or is doing, is working for her and she looks great, we just kind of wish she would come clean about having a fake booty.</p><h2 id=7-nicole-kidman><strong>7. Nicole Kidman</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Kidman</a> is without a doubt one of the most talented actresses on the planet. Her effortless grace in combination with her natural good looks and raw talent are just a few reasons why she has had so much success in her field. Kidman has played so many different roles, in films such as Moulin Rouge, Eyes Wide Shut, The Hours&nbsp;and many others that help&nbsp;show just how talented she truly is. Kidman was also known for being a natural beauty, but is that the case anymore?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly it looks like Kidman has recently been doing a little too much Botox to her face. While Kidman denies ever receiving any sort of cosmetic surgery, there is no denying that has been looking rather tight in the last few years. Her face has obviously had some sort of work done, although the actress denies it completely.</p><h2 id=6-renee-zellweger><strong>6. Renee Zellweger</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Renee Zellweger</a> is a phenomenal actress who has been appearing in movies for half her life. Zellweger recently made headlines, not for a movie she was in or a project she was part of, but because of her dramatically changed face. Earlier this year, Zellweger made a red carpet appearance that shocked the world and caused enough internet reaction that she subsequently "broke the internet."</p><p>Although the changes on her face were more than obvious, the actress was not happy about the accusations and denied allegations completely. The actress came back with an incredible response that was extremely moving, however, we at TheRichest do not buy it. The proof is in the photo and Zellweger has definitely had work done on her face, no doubt in our mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-angelina-jolie><strong>5. Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p>When it comes to being outrageously gorgeous, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a> is at the top of our list. The Academy Award winning actress is passionate, talented and has a fierce desire to better this world. The bombshell of an actress has been making news recently for her divorce to fellow actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a>. However, this list is not designed to talk about Jolie's failed marriage, it is to talk about the cosmetic surgeries the actress denies having. Although Jolie has repeatedly denied having any work done, it is very obvious that her nose has changed throughout the years. Jolie has also been rumored to have had a few facelifts, done Botox and some other fillers over the years. We at TheRichest are fairly certain that she has undergone a procedure or two and wish that she would not constantly deny it...Her famous lips however, those are real!</p><h2 id=4-megan-fox><strong>4. Megan Fox</strong></h2><p>This is one that is surprising&nbsp;- after all,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Fox</a> is a sex symbol of our generation. The stunning actress has gotten far in her career due to her talent and good looks. Although a lot of people believe the actress to be all natural, the truth is that she is far from being natural. Looking at old photographs of Fox, it is obvious that she has dramatically changed her face over the years. From lip augmentations to fillers and Botox, the actress has tweaked her look here and there. The beautiful Fox has even gotten her nose done! Even though the changes on her face are evident, Fox denies having anything done to her face whatsoever. If you do not believe us, just compare photographs of her now to then! Yes, we know people grow up, but when you grow up you don't get bigger lips and a smaller nose!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-kim-kardashian><strong>3. Kim Kardashian</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a> is the most photographed person in the world. Her husband says her talent is being beautiful, and we at TheRichest couldn't agree more. Kardashian is annoying to a lot of people, yes, but there is no denying that she is nice to look at. Kim Kardashian made a career off of her looks and although she has always been beautiful, her plastic surgeries have helped a lot. Kardashian has been rumored to have gotten her nose and lips done, as well as her famous booty. She has also been accused of having liposuction and cellulite reductions. The celebrity denies almost all of the accusations, but photographs of Kardashian show that there have been changes made to her face and body. Recently, she came clean admitting that she does injections in her behind but said that was the only thing she has had done.</p><h2 id=2-nicki-minaj><strong>2. Nicki Minaj</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Minaj </a>is one of the most successful female rappers of all time. Minaj was able to break through in the male-dominated industry and has continuously proven to the world that there is a place for women in hip-hop. Minaj is talented, smart and beautiful. It is clear when you see how determined and ambitious she is, why she was able to accomplish her dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However this list is not about how talented she is, this list is about the work she has gotten done throughout her rise to fame. Minaj has been rumored to have received numerous cosmetic surgeries on both her body and her face. Minaj has admitted to having work done on her breasts&nbsp;but stays quiet about the rest of her body. She avoids questions regarding her booty and has repeatedly said that she owes a lot of her look to contouring and make-up. Although we do not believe Minaj, we will just say we do.</p><h2 id=1-kylie-jenner><strong>1. Kylie Jenner</strong></h2><p>“I’m not against plastic surgery, full disclosure: I’ve only been under once before, when I went to the dentist and I didn’t react well; it really scared me. I threw up and I was SO nauseous the next day. But as of now, I only have lip fillers. Like I’ve said before, it has always been a huge insecurity of mine and I wanted to make a change.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This, which was said by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner</a> is one of the biggest lies the Kardashian family has ever told. Kylie Jenner, the youngest of the Kardashians is only a teenager and she is unrecognizable in comparison to younger photos of her. She finally admitted to her lips but denies any other procedures. However, by looking at both her face and her body, it is pretty obvious that she has had numerous procedures done. One of the biggest rumors came that she had butt implants after photos emerged of her on the beach this past summer.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>mirror.co.uk</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plasticsurgeryportal.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>celebplasticsurgeryonline.com,</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2owaK%2B0maroZmkYrWiwsRmm56mmZqxbrvBr6CoraNiva2t0q2gnGWjqr%2BosdGyZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-laundry-detergent-eczema.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="7 Best Laundry Detergents for Eczema">&larr;
