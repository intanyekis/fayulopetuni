Having been absent from our screens for many years, the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rush Hour </a></strong>star&nbsp;found himself at the center of a bizarre rumor that singer-songwriter <strong>India Arie</strong> is his long term girlfriend, only the pair are purported to have kept their romance a secret. The arty Arie certainly seems like an unusual partner for comedian Chris Tucker, but a lot of fans were&nbsp;convinced that the two&nbsp;were a couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Where Do Chris Tucker And Jackie Chan Stand Today?</a></span></p><p>But why exactly would&nbsp;their relationship be kept a secret? And how did this rumor spread like wildfire? The internet is a weird place at the best of times and we put the blame squarely&nbsp;on the power of social media. Here we explain the bizarre rumor that India Arie is secretly Chris Tucker's girlfriend.</p><h2 id=who-is-india-arie><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Who Is India Arie?</span></h2><p>The lady at the heart of the dating rumor is India Arie, a quadruple Grammy Award-winning, multitalented singer and songwriter.&nbsp;Arie, 45,&nbsp;has collaborated and duetted with music legends such as Stevie Wonder and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele</a>&nbsp;and has sold an incredible 10 million albums worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-exactly-is-the-rumor><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>What Exactly Is The Rumor?</span></h2><p>The farfetched claim is that Arie and Tucker have been dating for over 13 years, but have chosen to keep&nbsp;their relationship&nbsp;a secret. Seeing as Tucker hasn't been officially linked&nbsp;to any notable romantic partners since the 2000s, we can understand why so many fans would be drawn to this rumor.</p><h2 id=this-is-how-it-started><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>This Is How It Started</span></h2><p>It all started with a simple Tweet last year. When photographer G Steven Roper took to Twitter on Jun 5th 2020, he couldn't have imagined the pandemonium that his 11 words would create.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2021's Newest Celebrity Couples</a></span></p><p>"Chris Tucker and India Arie have been dating for 13 years??!" he exclaimed above a photo of the "couple".</p><h2 id=it-didn-t-take-long-for-the-rumor-to-escalate><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>It Didn't Take Long For The Rumor To Escalate</span></h2><p>Social media is a breeding ground for misinformation. Within minutes,&nbsp;Roper's Tweet went viral.&nbsp;Incredibly, it has 30k likes, 7.7k retweets, and over 300 comments. Fans were quick to express their joy for the couple, and also praised their supposed commitment to maintaining privacy.</p><p>"This is how you be in a relationship the levels of just pure goodness in this," commented one user, adding, "damn give them there [sic] flowers cause it took our nosey a**es to long to find out."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-there-any-evidence-that-they-dated><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is There Any Evidence That They Dated?</span></h2><p>In 2007, Arie and Tucker were spotted together at a charitable event for Oprah's philanthropic effort, Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa. This is likely where the notion that they've been together for 13 years originated.&nbsp;Photos of the&nbsp;pair at the event certainly exhibit an element of intimacy.</p><h2 id=this-is-how-arie-initially-responded-to-the-claims><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>This Is How Arie Initially Responded To The Claims</span></h2><p>Arie first jokingly responded to the&nbsp;rumor by Tweeting, "Me and Chris Tucker been dating for 13 years?!!! 13 YEARS?! Whew Chile! That's some STRONG BLACK (LOVE) Tea".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 10 Most Famous Hollywood Chrises Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Some took the tongue in cheek Tweet as an admission of truth, with one user replying, "R u serious? I admire the both of you, opposite attracts. Put a ring on it CT".</p><h2 id=she-is-adamant-that-they-are-not-a-couple-but-they-did-date-in-the-past><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>She Is Adamant That They Are Not A Couple, But They Did Date In The Past</span></h2><p>Shortly after, Arie clarified the nature of her relationship with Tucker. "Soooo, NO. I Do not date @christuckerreal&nbsp;∼ we went on A date or 2 ... apparently that was 13 years ago? I really don't remember Lol", she explained on Twitter.</p><h2 id=this-is-why-the-story-went-viral><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>This Is Why The Story Went Viral</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans were disappointed to discover that Arie and Tucker have not been secretly dating for 13 years. However, one Twitter user&nbsp;astutely&nbsp;pointed out why the rumor&nbsp;went viral in the first place: "thank you for allowing us to create our own romcom & soundtrack on the internet!!!! it almost made us forget how stupid planet earth is. 💙😂"</p><p>Essentially, the frenzy surrounding the rumor provided some much needed escapism from the realities of life, particularly in these post-Covid times.</p><h2 id=tucker-hasn-t-responded-to-the-rumor><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tucker Hasn't Responded To The Rumor</span></h2><p>At the time of writing, Tucker has been reluctant to comment on the nature of his relationship with Arie. Accordingly, he has neither confirmed nor denied the rumor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It should be noted that Tucker has recently been in the spotlight for some very problematic reasons: it has surfaced&nbsp;that he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hung out with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</a> (Tucker was also on his flight logs), the financier's pal Ghislaine Maxwell, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disgraced actor Kevin Spacey</a>, so he may just be keeping a low profile.</p><h2 id=is-2000s-nostalgia-at-the-heart-of-this-rumor><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Is 2000s Nostalgia At The Heart Of This Rumor?</span></h2><p>Every generation has its sacred period of nostalgia. In the 2020s, it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the 2000s</a> that have left people reminiscing about the good old days, with a number of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reboots of classic noughties shows</a> being testament to this.</p><p>Perhaps the reason why the Arie/Tucker rumor blew up is that both are stars of the 2000s and, much like fans' joy at the return of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bennifer</a>, Arie and Tucker represent a simpler, bygone era that many want back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Talked About US Star Appearances On UK Reality TV</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZorKRp7%2BmedGupKiqXZ67pbXAZpiroZVitrR50p6aq52kocZur8eroKxlpKqwrLHRZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1knrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zach-ertz-htm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zach Ertz - Bio, Age, net worth, weight, height, Wiki, Facts and Family">&larr;
