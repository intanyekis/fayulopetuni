However, it is important to note that this claim is not real and is merely a prank. The post was shared by an NFL fan on Tuesday and has already garnered over 213,000 views. It includes a screenshot of a tweet that appears to be written by Dua Lipa, expressing interest in George Kittle.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Background_of_the_Viral_Post></span>Background of the Viral Post<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure id=attachment_23460 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-23460 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Dua Lipa hit on married NFL star</figure><p>The Twitter user who shared the post expressed their loyalty to George Kittle and his wife Claire, stating that they would “die for Claire & George Kittle” and urging Dua Lipa to back off. While this prank fooled many social media users, it is important to clarify that Dua Lipa did not actually hit on the NFL star.</p><p>Similar pranks have occurred in the past, such as a viral tweet claiming that Taylor Swift was dating NFL star Quenton Nelson, which also turned out to be a hoax. It is crucial to approach such claims with skepticism and verify their authenticity before drawing conclusions.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Clarification_of_the_Relationship_Statuses></span>Clarification of the Relationship Statuses<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>To dispel any confusion, it is important to clarify the relationship statuses of the individuals involved. George Kittle, the San Francisco 49ers tight-end, is happily married to his wife Claire. They have a strong and committed relationship.</p><p>On the other hand, Dua Lipa is currently dating French director Romain Gavras. They have been together for some time and have publicly appeared together at events such as the Cannes Film Festival. According to sources, they are still “very happy” together and have been mutually supportive of each other’s creative endeavors.</p><p>It is essential to separate fact from fiction and not jump to conclusions based on viral pranks or false claims. In this case, the post suggesting that Dua Lipa hit on George Kittle is entirely untrue, and both individuals are in committed relationships with other partners.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Reactions_to_the_Prank></span>Reactions to the Prank<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Post-claiming-Dua-Lipa-hit-on-married-NFL-star-with.jpg alt="How Tall is Dua Lipa?

These reactions highlight the level of investment and support that fans have for their favorite celebrities and their personal lives.</p><p>However, not everyone fell for the prank. Some Twitter users quickly recognized that the post was a hoax and pointed out the inconsistencies and unlikely nature of the tweet. They humorously commented on the fact that Dua Lipa probably has no knowledge of who George Kittle is, further emphasizing the implausibility of the situation. This recognition of the prank demonstrates the skepticism and critical thinking that some social media users employ when encountering sensational or unbelievable content.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Belief_in_the_Prank></span>Belief in the Prank<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Many social media users initially believed the prank, as evidenced by the numerous comments expressing concern for George Kittle and his marriage. These individuals were genuinely worried about the potential impact of Dua Lipa’s alleged advances on the couple’s relationship. Their emotional investment in the lives of their favorite celebrities led them to react strongly to the prank, defending the sanctity of George Kittle’s marriage and expressing their loyalty to the couple.</p><p>These reactions also highlight the power of social media and the influence it has on shaping public perception. The viral nature of the post, with over 213,000 views, contributed to the spread of the prank and the subsequent reactions it generated. It serves as a reminder of the need for critical thinking and fact-checking in the age of online information, as false or misleading content can easily be disseminated and believed by unsuspecting individuals.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Recognition_of_the_Prank></span>Recognition of the Prank<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>While many social media users initially believed the prank, there were also those who quickly recognized it as a hoax. These individuals pointed out the lack of credibility in the screenshot of the tweet and questioned the likelihood of Dua Lipa actually making such a statement. Their skepticism and ability to discern the authenticity of the post demonstrate the importance of critical thinking and media literacy in navigating the vast amount of information available online.</p><p>Recognizing the prank allowed these individuals to approach the situation with a sense of humor and engage in lighthearted banter. They playfully commented on the absurdity of the situation and made jokes about Dua Lipa’s knowledge of George Kittle. This ability to discern between genuine and fake content is crucial in maintaining a healthy skepticism and avoiding the spread of misinformation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Similar_Hoaxes_in_the_Past></span>Similar Hoaxes in the Past<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hoaxes and fake rumors are not uncommon in the world of celebrities and social media. The recent viral post claiming that Dua Lipa hit on NFL star George Kittle is just one example of such a prank. However, it is important to note that this is not an isolated incident.

These incidents highlight how easily false information can spread on social media platforms and how quickly it can be believed by unsuspecting users.</p><p>In both cases, fans and followers of the celebrities were quick to react, expressing their love and support for the artists while also defending the individuals who were falsely implicated in the rumors. It is interesting to observe the dynamics of fan culture and how fans rally around their favorite celebrities in times of controversy or false accusations.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Impact_of_Hoaxes_on_Celebrities></span>Impact of Hoaxes on Celebrities<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hoaxes and fake rumors can have a significant impact on celebrities and their personal lives. While some fans may quickly realize that the information is false, others may believe it and spread it further, leading to unnecessary speculation and intrusion into the private lives of the celebrities involved.</p><p>In the case of Dua Lipa, the hoax claiming that she hit on George Kittle not only garnered a significant number of views but also prompted fans to express their concern and support for Kittle and his wife Claire. This highlights the potential harm that can be caused by false rumors, as they can disrupt the personal relationships and privacy of individuals.</p><p>Celebrities often have to deal with the consequences of such hoaxes, including addressing the rumors publicly and clarifying the truth. It can be a challenging task for them to navigate through the world of social media and separate fact from fiction. However, it is important for fans and followers to exercise caution and verify information before jumping to conclusions or spreading false rumors.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dua_Lipas_Current_Relationship_Status></span>Dua Lipa’s Current Relationship Status<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dua Lipa is currently in a relationship with French director Romain Gavras.
