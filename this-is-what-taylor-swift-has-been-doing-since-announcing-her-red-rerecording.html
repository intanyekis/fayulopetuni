Whether <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift </a></strong>posts an announcement or they are analyzing a photo she posted or coming up with another theory, every day seems to be chaotic in the fandom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift announced her re-recording of her fourth album, Red, on June 18. She said the album would be out on November 19 and would have 30 songs, but they just disappeared from social media, leaving fans in a frenzy.</p><p>Swift has to rerecord her first six albums in order to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obtain all of the masters for them</a> under new label. So far, she has <a href=#>released Fearless (Taylor's Version) </a>and soon Red (Taylor's Version). But, she has been sending mixed signals that are driving fans insane.</p><p>Even though she is, this is what Taylor Swift has been doing since announcing her Red rerecording.</p><h2 id=supported-friend-ed-sheeran><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Supported Friend Ed Sheeran</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After few days after Swift announced her rerecording of Red, she retweeted Ed Sheeran's comeback single, "Bad Habits." She tweeted saying she "legitimately cannot get it out of my head." Swift and Sheeran have been friends for a long time with Sheeran being her opening act on the The Red Tour. Now, with Red (Taylor's Version) coming out in a few months, they will have two collaborations on the album <a href=#>and continue to remain friends.</a> Whether it was to support her new album or just show support for her friend, we are here for the comradery.</p><h2 id=39-renegade-39><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>'Renegade'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift worked with Aaron Dessner on her latest two albums, folklore and evermore and has loved him as a songwriter for a long time. Dessner is part of the indie band Big Red Machine with Justin Vernon (Bon Iver), whom Swift also collaborated with on the albums. So, of course, because Swift never stops working, she recorded the song "Renegade" with the band. It was released on July 2. During an interview with Zane Lowe, Dessner spoke on how the song came about. "This song was something we wrote after we finished evermore and it dawned on us that this was a BRM [Big Red Machine] song. Taylor's words hit me so hard when I heard her first voice memo and still do, every time."</p><h2 id=the-original-version-of-39-the-lakes-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Original Version Of 'The Lakes'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To celebrate one year of folklore, Swift released the original version of the bonus track song, "the lakes." "To say thank you for all you have done to make this album what it was. I wanted to give you the original version of The Lakes. Happy 1 year anniversary to Rebekah, Betty, Inez, James, Augustine and the stories we all created around them. Happy Anniversary, folklore," she tweeted. Although all of the lyrics are the same, the instrumentals are bigger and sound more like an orchestra. Fans were loving the original version. She also released anniversary merch on her website.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Red (Taylor's Version)' Is Coming: Everything We Know About Taylor Swift's Next Rerecord</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-recorded-audio-for-the-olympics><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Taylor Swift Recorded Audio For The Olympics</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone was in awe of our athletes this year at the Olympics and Taylor Swift was no exception. She filmed a spot titled "Trying" set to the tune of her song "this is me trying." Although some commercials showed our female soccer athletes and our gymnasts, one commercial focused on Simon Biles- on her journey at the Tokyo games after withdrawing from multiple events as the games to focus on her mental health. Like Swift, Biles is someone who is known by everyone and have everything you do scrutinized by the public.</p><p>"Throughout the last week, her voice has been as significant as her talents, her honesty as beautiful as the perfection that had long been her signature. But don't you see? It still is. She's perfectly human. And that's what makes it so easy to call her a hero. Simone Biles. Back on the beam. In Tokyo," she said in the promo. Biles responded and it was a lovefest on Twitter between the two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=released-the-39-red-taylor-39-s-version-vault-tracks><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Released The 'Red (Taylor's Version) Vault Tracks</span></h2><p>It was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer when Swift posted the jumbled up vault tracks for Red (Taylor's Version). There are 30 songs in total, 10 of them vault tracks and most of them never heard before. She revealed that they will be collaborations with Sheeran, Phoebe Bridgers and Chris Stapleton. Her versions of "Babe" and "Better Man" will appear on the album, as well as the 10-minute version of "All Too Well."<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> And "Ronan," which has never appeared on an album before</a>, will also be on it. Fans went insane trying to solve everything correctly, but after a few hours Swift posted the songs and got everyone excited for the release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Fans Are Saying About Taylor Swift's Next Rerecorded Album</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-joined-tiktok><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Taylor Swift Joined TikTok</span></h2><p>Yep, that's right. Taylor Swift actually joined TikTok. She has only posted a handful of videos, mostly ones about her albums and her cats, but fans are loving the content and getting an inside look into her life. She has commented on and liked a lot of fans videos, which just made their day. And some fans think she is dropping hints about new music and that <a href=#>1989 (Taylor's Version) may be coming sooner than we think.</a> We love to see her having fun and interacting with fans. But she doesn't do something just for the sake of doing something. There is always meaning behind it, so what exactly is she up to?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-birch-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>'Birch'</span></h2><p>Along with "Renegade," Swift had another song on Big Red Machine's album, How Long Is It Gonna Last? When the album was released, fans got to hear "Birch," another song that featured Swift. Track 4 and 5 on the album went over well with fans and they were excited to have new music from her, along with discovering another band. We can only imagine that Swift, Dessner and Vernon will continue working together in the future after the success of her eighth and ninth albums.</p><h2 id=supported-her-boyfriend-at-his-movie-premiere><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Supported Her Boyfriend At His Movie Premiere</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While everyone was partying it up at the VMAs, Taylor Swift was noticeably absent. She was nominated for multiple awards that night but did not attend or perform and shockingly, did not win. But she was just shaking off the award's show, as she supported her long-time boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn. The pair were in Northern Ireland,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> where he is shooting </a><a href=#>Conversations with Friends.</a> Pictures online of her with fans emerged and Twitter erupted.</p><p>Fans think she might have been there longer since she posted the one year of folklore pictures which appeared to be in Donegal. It is unclear how long the 31-year-old was in Ireland for.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What Really Went Down Between Taylor Swift And Scooter Braun</a></span></p><h2 id=surprise-released-39-wildest-dreams-taylor-39-s-version-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Surprise Released 'Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swifties can never go to sleep. Just as fans are gearing up to hear the newest rerecord, Taylor went and dropped "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)," a single from her album 1989. She posted that because the sound was trending on TikTok, due to a recent trend that she wanted the fans to have her version and dropped the full song a few hours later. Since "Wildest Dreams" is a popular song of hers, fans were ecstatic to get the new version with many fans saying how happy they were that "she owns her heartbeat now." After posting another TikTok with the sound in it and winking, could Swift have something up her sleeve and surprise drop 1989 (Taylor's Version)? Hopefully.</p><h2 id=dropped-signed-39-fearless-taylor-39-s-version-39-s-cds><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Dropped Signed 'Fearless (Taylor's Version)'s CDs</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To confuse fans even more, a week after releasing "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)," she dropped signed Fearless (Taylor's Version) CDs in her merch store online. As excited as fans were to finally have a signed copy of her sophomore album in their hands, they were also confused. What era is it exactly? It's Taylor Swift's world, and we're just living in it. Stay tuned because this information could all change. She could drop a new single on September 22nd, because it's the first day of Fall and Red is a fall album or she could leave fans hanging until later.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Songs Taylor Swift Has Written About Her Boyfriend Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edahmK1lpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapeqmt0maZnp2eYrGwtc2gZKyhnpiybq3Np6auppOeu6h5x56pZqqVmXqzsdGemqiqlJ67qHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nfl-deion-sanders-facts-trivia-things-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Things NFL Fans Should Know About Deion Sanders">&larr;
