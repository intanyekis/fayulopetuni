Yes, fans hoping to spoil the ending days or weeks prior to Scream 5's debut will be hard-pressed to do so accurately. The reason is the film's production crew shot multiple endings, and in laments terms, means anyone trying to leak the climax might be entirely wrong once the actual movie is out. It's worth mentioning that producers/directors taking this route aren't out of the ordinary. In the digital age, where leaks are everyday occurrences, sometimes it's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> necessary to have multiple endings</a> to throw noisy dwellers off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Walking Dead</a> pulled the same maneuver when spoiler hounds attempted to unveil a principal character's death on the show in Season 7. It didn't work to their benefit because the leaked clip touted online featuring a different character turned out to be a red herring. The actual result was a shot-for-shot from one of the graphic novels.</p><h2 id=alternate-endings>Alternate Endings</h2><p>As far as Scream 5 goes, there can be many possible endings. Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloody Disgusting</a> attested to that fact. They also threw out the interesting point that multiple cuts of the movie also exist. That ruins anyone's chances of getting the real ending out early. But we may have a couple of ideas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scream4-BloodyDisgusting-1.jpg><p>With Neve Campbell and the rest of the Scream crew all back, more than likely, one end features Sidney Prescott (Campbell) getting murdered. Prescott's escaped death on multiple occasions, of course, with the possibility of Scream 5 being the last chapter, Sidney succumbing to her fate isn't that farfetched. Even if that's not the actual ending, shooting a couple of scenes where Campbell's character gets brutally stabbed to death or dies in some other horrific manner would throw people off. Such a plotline sounds like tremendous news, which is why it's perfect as a red herring for this film. Of course, we shouldn't discount the theory altogether. Maybe it is time Sidney bites the dust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Money Was Jamie Lee Curtis Paid To Star In Halloween?</a></span></p><p>Another leak that would entice noisy nellies is a secret betrayal long in the making. We all know Sidney's niece felt jealous of her aunt's spotlight and sought to take it from her, but what if a friend who's survived all of their adventures held a secret grudge? There are only two suspects in that category, Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courtney Cox). Dewey is a longshot because he's put his neck on the line for Sidney before, but Gale, she's got motive.</p><p>Remember, Cox's character struggled to sustain her stardom after the first film. Gale tried to bank off the various rounds of murders, and it worked for a time, though Scream 4 proved that her time as a reporter is ending. If that realization sinks in, having Gale admit she wants Ghostface to kill Sidney for the story could motivate her to act on her own. She knows Prescott is all but impervious to death, and the only way to get the scoop she needs is by getting the ball rolling herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A surprise of that magnitude would ideally be one of the alternate endings that Olpin and Gillett shot to throw people off. They might have taken things one step further and gone with Dewey becoming the killer, but there'd have to be a significant subplot explaining it for said transformation to make sense. Otherwise, the betrayal would come out of nowhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of surprises, maybe the directors thought of disrupting the status quo in a different ending. Instead of simply focusing on Sidney's fight for survival, there's a possibility that they shot a conclusion where all the principal characters face life-or-death situations, and they don't make it out. Killing off three or more stars in one outing is risky, but since the directors are taking extra precautions with Scream 5, we wouldn't be surprised to learn that there's an ending where a new killer stabs Dewey, Gale, and Sidney all to death. Again, a risky move plot-wise, but it could segue into a new series of films centered on original characters.</p><p>Whatever Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett did with these alternate endings, hopefully, they release them later on. It would intrigue fans to know exactly how they planned on keeping spoiler addicts at bay because they might be how we pictured them, or they could border on the most unpredictable. Either way, we want to see these Scream 5 endings.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This 'Scream' Fan Theory Says That Dewey Is Ghostface</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqivsRmq6GdXaW8tL%2FIm6OeZZGhwaa%2BzZqroq6VYrKvsMinnqxllqS%2Fbr%2FCq5yapV1qfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tiffany-haddish-shares-sexy-swimsuit-photos-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tiffany Haddish Shares Sexy Swimsuit Photos During Vacation on Instagram">&larr;
