Acknowledging their solid bond and strong connection, it’ll be truly shocking as well as disheartening for the fans to see the couple wind-up their relationship at any time now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=college-football-coach-scott-frost-%e2%80%93-height-age-retire></span>College Football Coach Scott Frost – Height, Age & Retire<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He might have retired from his position as Tampa’s quarterback 15 years ago but Scott is still as fit as ever with well-sculpted physique, masculine biceps and chiseled chest. Through a scheduled workout routine, strict diet plan, and exercise including cardio and jogging, Frost has kept own-self fit and healthy all this time.</p><p>In fact, he is one of the few coaches who hasn’t changed a bit since his playing days with dashing teenage looks, stylish appearance, and strong personality.</p><p>Surprisingly, Scott looks dreamier than ever before with youthful countenance, expressive blue eyes, beaming skin that barely has any wrinkles, and engaging smile. At age 44, he still is as good-looking and charming as ever with sharp cheekbone and scruffy facial hair that makes him even more attractive.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=scott-frost-and-ashley-neidhardt-salary-net-worth-%e2%80%93-35-million-dollars></span>Scott Frost and Ashley Neidhardt Salary & Net Worth –&nbsp; $35 Million Dollars<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although reckoned as one of the most successful college football coaches in Nebraska, former Kansas coach Scott Frost projected fortune is still under the shade. Earlier, he had signed a seven-year contract worth $35 million as a head coach for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln which made Scott the highest paid coach in the history of Nebraska.</p><p>His hefty annual salary worth $5 million as a head coach at Nebraska left him just behind Ohio State city’s Urban Meyer and Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh to be the highest paid football coach ranking him third in the Big Ten.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=scott-frost-ashley-neidhardt-children></span>Scott Frost & Ashley Neidhardt Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Scott Frost little boy scored considerable media attention long before he was born and he’ll probably end up having a successful career just like his dad. But it’s quite early to say anything as the mysterious young chap is still too young living a blissful life under the heavy scrutiny of his mom.</p><p>But it has to be agreed that he didn’t get on the way of his dad’s success as a head football coach of UCF Knights Football otherwise Frost would’ve been devastated.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=scott-frost-wife-ashley-neidhardt-%e2%80%93-any-divorce-plan></span>Scott Frost Wife Ashley Neidhardt – Any Divorce Plan?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>They’ve been virtually inseparable ever since their marriage. And Scott Frost and his longtime love Ashley Neidhardt certainly looked a picture-perfect couple every while and then they made their media appearance together.</p><p>Sparked romance rumors in 2013, the duo secretly dated each other for two years before deciding to get married. They tied the knot in early 2016 in Paradise Valley, Arizona, that came rightly just after five months Scott popped the question.</p><p>Within a year after the wedding, the lovebird welcomed their first child, a baby boy that eventually created a buzz as his wife due date was on the very same day UCF Knights had a game at SMU. But it surely turned to be a great day for Scott as his team won the game and his wife gave birth to the baby boy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuTpMG1ecWrpqysXay2p7GMmqqhpJWueq%2BxyJ2fmqqUqXq0rcuaqbJlnprBbsPOq6uhZZGcsm60xKKeoaxdmLWquMOrnKdn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./174877-terri-irwin-reveals-how-she-first-met-cr-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Terri Irwin Reveals How She First Met 'Crocodile Hunter' Husband Steve Irwin">&larr;
