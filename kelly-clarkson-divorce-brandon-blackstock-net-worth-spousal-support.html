She was a waitress who proved herself to be super talented, and her career has only shot up from there. From being a judge on The Voice to hosting The Kelly Clarkson Show, Kelly has shown that she has a talent for chatting with people and having fun, not just singing, and that everything Kelly touches turns to gold.</p><p>When Kelly got married in 2013, it looked like her personal life was just as successful as her personal. That is why when it was announced that <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly was getting a divorce from Brandon Blackstock</a>, fans were shocked. But like many celebrities who are having issues with their marriages, Kelly kept things quiet until things could no longer be kept under wraps, which is the one and only reason that the announcement was made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Divorce is always a lot more complex when a couple has children.

She admitted that more often than not she pretended publicly things were fine, when in reality, things were messier than the media was aware of.</p><p>The divorce, which was announced in 2020, was finalized in March 2022. At that time, Kelly was awarded primary custody. However, she also had to pay a hefty amount of money to her ex, Brandon Blackstock. Outside of a lump sum of $1.3 million, Kelly has to pay over $45,000 per month in child support and has to pay spousal support to the tune of $115,000 per month until January 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Kelly has a hefty net worth, spending this amount monthly does put a dent into Kelly's fortune. Fortunately for Kelly, her spousal support payments will be coming to an end soon, so that will stop the massive monthly hemorrhaging she has grown accustomed to for the last couple of years.</p><p>Kelly also has an opportunity to make up that net worth, given that 'The Kelly Clarkson Show' which was recently moved from Los Angeles to New York City, has been renewed through 2025. But knowing Kelly, that is not all she has up her sleeves professionally, and she will likely be growing her net worth for years to come.</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-owes-spousal-support-to-brandon-blackstock>Kelly Clarkson Owes Spousal Support To Brandon Blackstock</h2><h3 id=total-spousal-support-owed-115-000-per-month>Total Spousal Support Owed: $115,000 Per Month</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar50300226-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly Clarkson's salary from The Voice</a> is very high, but she has to pay her ex-husband a lot of money each month.</p><p>While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kelly has a $45 million net worth</a>, her divorce has definitely meant spending some serious cash. This is because <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kelly owes Brandon $165,601 monthly</a> in spousal and child support.</p><p>Kelly's child support payments will be $45,601 each month and her spousal support payments will be $115,000 per month. Kelly also had to pay a lump sum of $1.3 million to Brandon, so it's safe to say that definitely cuts into her net worth.</p><p>According to People, Brandon had asked for a lot more money. He wanted $135,000 for child support a spousal support payment of $301,000, which would have meant that Kelly would have paid him $436,000 each month.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly Clarkson Gave Her Ex A Heads Up About Her Divorce Album, Then Shaded Him On Stage</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Us Weekly, a source said that "Brandon was just using her for her money and lifestyle" as Kelly's monthly salary is $2 million. The source said that Kelly wasn't happy at all, saying, "The marriage was really, really awful at the end. Kelly felt that she could no longer trust Brandon.

According to Radar, court documents show that she spent $100,000 along with $1,187,525 for fees and lawyers.</p><p>The judge said that Kelly had to give her ex-husband $250,000, so a forensic accountant could research the money that she has, and she also was told to give him $1 million to pay for his legal fees.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's interesting to compare celebrity divorces to what other divorces cost. According to Business Insider, each spouse will typically pay $15,000. But when it comes to legal fees, the cost depends on how short the divorce is. If the divorce takes a long time, more money will be spent.</p><p>As for what celebrity divorces usually cost, some can get extremely pricey. According to Insider.com, the settlement in Guy Richie and Madonna's divorce was between $76 million and $92 million.</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-39-s-life-after-getting-divorced>Kelly Clarkson's Life After Getting Divorced</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kelly-clarkson-debuts-slender-figure-as-she-says-she-s-working-on-herself-after-heartbreaking-divorce-1.jpg><p>Kelly said she wanted to talk about her divorce because she didn't think that it made sense to keep it private.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I mean, if anything, I've fought my entire career just to be me," Kelly explained. "Because most managers and publicists get nervous with me because I am an open book and labels and people frowned upon it early on. But, I don't do it for anyone else, honestly. I don't know, I come from a small town, I'm used to everybody knowing everything anyway."</p><p>Kelly continued, "And, I don't know, I feel like if you're hiding something, there must be something wrong with it. And there's nothing wrong with anything -- life just kind of happens, and it takes turns that you don't expect and are sad."</p><p>Us Weekly reported that while Kelly says she doesn't have "regrets" about marrying Brandon, she doesn't think that another marriage is in the cards for her. She said that it's hard for her to notice "red flags."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly Clarkson Changed The Lyrics To Piece By Piece Following Her Divorce From Brandon Blackstock</a></span></p><p>While it seems like Kelly Clarkson's divorce from Brandon has been tough, she did have some fun talking to Sandra Bullock on her talk show. According to Page Six, both stars began laughing when Sandra said, "My parents were good singers. They’re dead." Kelly responded, "That's cool."</p><p>When Sandra asked if Kelly really meant that it was great that they had passed away, Kelly made it clear that wasn't what she meant. Kelly said, “No! That they’re singers! That’s so sad that they’re dead," and they both kept laughing.</p><p>Source: People, Us Weekly, Radar, Business Insider, Insider.com, Page Six</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqScrnqkuMCroqynnmKxqsLOq5qeZZKnrq%2Bwzqdkm6SRmLi0wM6comamlal6uLvRrZ9mq6CkwrSty2aqrqigpL%2B1ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./roger-bonds-diddy-former-head-of-security-cassie-lawsuit-statement-1234823220.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diddy's Former Head of Security Breaks Silence On Cassie's Lawsuit">&larr;
