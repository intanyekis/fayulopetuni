Still, the end of a relationship is always sad, and it's even harder when a couple has four kids like this famous pair does. Since fans are used to seeing Psalm, Chicago, Saint, and North West with Kim, that begs the question: is <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> mastermind Kanye still involved in his daughter's life?</p><p>There are many <a href=#>fascinating details about North West</a>, who is now 10 years old and in the news as much as her celebrity mom and dad. Here's whether Kanye West and North have a solid father/daughter relationship today and how much they get together.</p><h2 id=does-north-west-ever-see-her-father-kanye-west>Does North West Ever See Her Father Kanye West?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's custody arrangement</a> was final in November 2022. According to USA Today, the stars agreed on joint custody. Based on that arrangement, it seems that Kanye still sees all four of his children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Kim is most likely the parent who takes care of the kids most of the time, at least based on something that her ex-husband said. In September 2022, Insider.com reported that Kanye appeared on the Mind Full podcast and said, "Your home is your original church. So, even to this day, I'll still give Kim advice on things that can help, because that's gonna go to the kids. She's still gotta— basically 80 percent of the time— raise those children."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kim-and-kanye-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Kanye and Kim's exact co-parenting schedule is unknown, Kanye does see North, and they have regular father/daughter get-togethers. According to The Daily Mail, North played soccer in November 2022 and Kanye was the parent who came to get her afterward. They then went to a mall. The Sun reported in May 2023 that Kanye, Saint, and North went to Griffith Park Observatory. These news stories suggest that Kanye is definitely an involved parent.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside North West’s Friendship With Selena Gomez’s Sister Gracie Teefey</a></span></p><p>North and Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori also see each other on what must be a fairly regular basis. According to Page Six, Kanye celebrated his 46th birthday in June 2023. Bianca and North were holding hands with each other.</p><p>Kanye and Kim's divorce wasn't a smooth process at all, and as people could have predicted, it played out in the media for all to see. Kim and North often post TikTok videos on an account that they use together. As it turns out, Kanye didn't like that idea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian's Outburst Forced Kanye West's New Wife To Quit Social Media: Here's Why Bianca Censori Stays Out Of The Spotlight</a></span></p><p>According to Buzzfeed News, Kanye West posted on Instagram in February 2022 and wrote, "Since this is my first divorce I need to know what I should do about my daughter being put on TikTok against my will." This led to a series of back-and-forth social media posts, and it was clear that Kim was in a lot of pain during this time. She shared that Kanye's posts were affecting her negatively and seemed to wish that they could get along for the sake of their family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kanye-west-(1).jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite all this, though, North West still seems to think highly of her dad. Of course, she likely wasn't privy to those online exchanges and didn't know what her parents were saying to each other.</p><p>North West definitely seems to like her father's fashion sense. In August 2023, Us Weekly reported that North West was wearing a shirt that looked just like one that her father once wore. Back in 2004, Kanye had on a blue and orange shirt from Ralph Lauren when he appeared on TRL. Fans noticed that North was wearing a similar shirt in a TikTok video.</p><p>North West was born in 2013 and Kanye West and Kim Kardashian got married one year later. Since she's only 10 years old, she might only have vague memories of a time when her parents were married and lived together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-kanye-west-and-kim-kardashian-39-s-co-parenting-relationship-like>What Is Kanye West And Kim Kardashian's Co-Parenting Relationship Like?</h2><p>While of course there's no denying that Kanye West has been a controversial figure for quite some time now, his kids likely aren't aware of his public image. They are still really young and they probably don't know the offensive comments he has made or the scandals surrounding him. Fans can guess that as they get older, they will read more about their father and find out more information. But that won't change for a long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kim-Kardashian-Drops-West-From-Her-Instagram-After-Big-Divorce-Win.jpg><p>According to E! News, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian talked about co-parenting</a> in November 2022 on the podcast IRL. She explained, "I definitely protected him and I still will in the eyes of my kids, for my kids. So, in my home, my kids don't know anything that goes on in the outside world. It's hard. S--t like co-parenting, it's really f--king hard."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside North West's Relationship With Bianca Censori, And Why It's Troubling Kim Kardashian</a></span></p><p>While Kim doesn't pretend that co-parenting is no big deal, she definitely seems committed to doing the best that she can for her children. According to a TMZ article from May 2023, she and Kanye attended a soccer game that their son Saint was playing in.</p><p>Everything seemed to be okay during that game, and there didn't appear to be any problems between Kim and Kanye. They both seem to want to Kanye to have a relationship with his children, including North West, and they are moving forward as a family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kanye-west-kim-kardashian.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the exes seem to be communicating because Kim wants Kanye to see their children, things were much tougher in the beginning. According to People, Kim was interviewed on the podcast Not Skinny But Not Fat and she said that she didn't want to be in touch with Kanye for a while.</p><p>Kim said, "We went off and on. You know, we went about eight months without even speaking to each other at the beginning of the divorce. And then we started talking again and I went to the Donda premiere."</p><p>Kim made a point of explaining that even when she wasn't in contact with Kanye, he got together with their children. She said, "I mean, he would still see the kids and stuff. Him and I just took a minute of not talking."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYruwvtOhZLCdo6l6tLHEZpuanF2grq%2FFxGaunqukYq6nwMSrZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMn6mopV2gtq55ypqpnZmjnbaiuo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jacob-batalon-wiki-bio-age-career-relationshipand-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jacob Batalon: Wiki, Bio, Age, Career, Relationship,and Net worth">&larr;
