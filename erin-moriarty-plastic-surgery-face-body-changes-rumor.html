Entertainers left and right seem to partake in the ritual of transforming their appearance via surgical procedures that drastically (sometimes subtly) alter how they look. Recently, a treasured and beloved movie star reportedly joined the club: Erin Moriarty.</p><p>Erin Moriarty is best known in the entertainment industry for her various television and movie roles, such as The Boys, Blood Father, The Kings of Summer, and Captain Fantastic.</p><p>Recently, a before and after photo of Moriarty picked up traction on X (formerly Twitter) with fans flocking to their feeds to express their disbelief at The Boys star's obvious transformation.</p><h2 id=did-erin-moriarty-have-plastic-surgery>Did Erin Moriarty Have Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>All while fans flocked to X to air their grief over Erin Moriarty's unexpected face transformation, Moriarty has remained quiet.
