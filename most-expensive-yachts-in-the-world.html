Not because the alleged $4.8 billion yacht wouldn’t be the most expensive – that’s far more than the next most expensive yacht.</p><p>Instead, it’s not true because the History Supreme is not a real yacht. It doesn’t exist. But you wouldn’t know that from how the internet works.</p><p>BoatSafe.com raised questions about her rumored owner (an unnamed, wealthy man from Malaysia), pointing out that her supposed cost of $5 billion amounted to over a third of the richest man in Malaysia's net worth:</p><p>People have assumed that the owner would be a man named Robert Kuok, the richest man in Malaysia. His fortune is around $14.5 billion. If he was indeed the man who purchased this boat, it means he spent one third of all of his money on it. That’s a lot of money to invest in a single boat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if an individual with $15 billion decided to spend $5 billion on the History Supreme, Boat Safe uncovered what looked to be firm evidence of a hoax, pointing out the four images "looked a lot like the Baia One Hundred, a yacht made by Italian yacht makers Baia in 2008."</p><p>BoatSafe.com contacted Baia, which confirmed the images were theirs, and introduced another excellent question – how could a solid gold yacht be buoyant?</p><p>Baia’s sales manager said those photos were stolen from their website and doctored. So they were not new photos of an altered boat, but altered photos of an old boat. Moreover, and this is crucial, he also pointed out what should have been obvious to anyone working in boating news. If Hughes added 110 tons of gold to the boat, how the heck was it staying afloat?</p><p>If anything, the History Supreme is a good reminder that not everything that glitters turns out to be gold, that not everything flashy or exciting on the internet turns out to be true, and that the world's most expensive yacht would generate photographic evidence of its existence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Yacht's Purported Name:</strong></p></td><td><p>History Supreme</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Purported Valuation:</strong></p></td><td><p>"$5 Billion"</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Port Of Registration:</strong></p></td><td><p>Not Applicable</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Notable Features:</strong></p></td><td><p>Inability To Float, Impractical Specs</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Launched:</strong></p></td><td><p>Never Launched</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqejqXqmxM%2Bepayhppp6uq3CoausZZmjerW0xGauqKqcmXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anna-garza-and-jessica-garza-killed-in-fatal-car-accident-in-lowell-township.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anna Garza and Jessica Garza killed in fatal car accident in Lowell Township">&larr;
