He initially thought of Stanley Tucci for the role of unfulfilled entrepreneur, Amy Lau, played by stand-up comedian Ali Wong.</p><p>"I really didn't have much interest, nor the capabilities to handle that, to write about that," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lee told Variety</a> of the change. "The reason I abandoned Stanley Tucci-type very quickly was because — especially in the modern era — you have to talk about race [in that instance], and there's so many other shows that do that very well."</p><p>Still, he clarified that he didn't want to focus on the cast's race. "If Ali were another race, I still would have wanted to work with her," he noted. "She really embodies so much about this character that is perfect, and she brings so many nuanced layers to the role."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But thanks to Lee, he was able to reunite Wong with <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Walking Dead alum, Steven Yeun</a> who plays struggling contractor, Danny Cho. The two have been a great duo since before the Emmy-submitted show. Here's a closer look at their friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>What Really Happened To Adam Demos' Brad In The Second Season of Netflix's Sex/Life?</a></span></p><h2 id=ali-wong-amp-steven-yeun-have-worked-together-before-in-tuca-amp-bertie>Ali Wong & Steven Yeun Have Worked Together Before In Tuca & Bertie</h2><p>Wong and Yeun have previously worked together as voice actors of cohabiting partners, Bertie and Speckle in the animated sitcom, Tuca & Bertie. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Decider</a> in April 2019, Yeun said that he enjoyed playing Wong's boyfriend in the series.</p><p>"Working with Ali, is of course, wonderful," he said at that time. "She's fantastic, and to be able to play her boyfriend in this is even more fun. Animation is fun for me because I get to play characters I never would've been able to access before."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/fteemufagaai8q6.jpeg><p>As for Wong, she first thought there were rumors about her dating Yeun after he texted her about landing the gig. "I remember Steven had sent me a text saying, 'Oh, so Ali, so I guess I'm your boyfriend now,'" <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">she recalled to Collider</a>. "And I was so confused, because I thought that he was possibly accusing me of spreading rumors that he was my boyfriend, that we had hooked up, and I was like, 'What are you talking about?'"</p><p>She continued: "I had no idea that he had auditioned for Speckle. I knew that a lot of my friends had auditioned for Speckle, and they were so disappointed that they hadn't gotten the role. But I was so excited that it was Steven. It was the first thing I ever got to work on with Steven."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Does The Cast Of Umbrella Academy Think The Netflix Show Has Jumped The Shark?</a></span></p><h2 id=ali-wong-amp-steven-yeun-had-a-39-nice-connection-39-while-filming-beef>Ali Wong & Steven Yeun Had A 'Nice Connection' While Filming Beef</h2><p>In a recent video interview, Yeun said that Wong enabled them to make a "nice connection" on set, which helped them with their intense roles.

"Steven and I both <a href=# rel=nofollow>broke out in hives</a> after the show," she recounted.</p><p>"Mine was on my face. His was all over his body because he's weak like that," she continued. "It definitely took a toll on us, but we didn't even realize until after the show ended.

"I don't think we knew that was going to happen," she explained. "If we knew what we were going to put our bodies and minds through, maybe we wouldn't have said yes, but we're really glad we did."</p><p>Lee, who added, "Our bodies shut down," also commended his co-star in a Vanity Fair interview as she "did not hold back" in portraying her character.
