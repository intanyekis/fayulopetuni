She’s not shying away from the tricky subject as she wants to show up for the viewers and loyal fans.</p><p>“Even though Holly has been <a href=#>on holiday with her family</a>, she has been thinking about it a lot and tried to process the dramatic turn of events.</p><p>“She has thought about what she will say and written it in advance, taking her time to get the words right. It’s not something she’s being forced to do.</p><p>“It won’t be an easy moment for her, and she knows she could get emotional, but she thinks it’s the right thing to do and wants to speak about it in an honest way.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>“It will happen at the very beginning of Monday’s show.</p><p>“Holly was really upset to hear that Phil <a href=#>was feeling suicidal</a> amid the backlash since the scandal and doesn’t want him to be in any pain, so she will choose her words carefully and deliver them in a sensitive manner.”</p><p>Holly will be joined on the sofa on Monday by co-host Josie Gibson.</p><p>After her speech she will then focus on light entertainment topics.</p><p>She will interview Queen singer Adam Lambert to celebrate Pride month and the <a href=#>LGBT community</a>.</p><p>Staff have removed pictures of Phillip from the ITV corridors to signify a new era — but not as a snub to him, it is claimed.</p><p>In another move, phone-ins involving the public will be heavily vetted by production staff to filter out any attempted viewer outbursts over the scandal.</p><p>And interaction segments where viewers send in pictures and social media posts are being paused to avoid the risk of any abuse being targeted at the presenters.</p><p>Phillip told The Sun Holly <a href=#>did not know about his affair</a>.</p><p>He said: “I’ve lost my best friend. Holly did not know. And she was one of the first texts that I sent to say ‘I am so, so sorry, that I lied to you.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/msemail_stg_matthew_mcgreevy_phillip_schofield05jpg-JS821623317-1.jpg><p>A source said: “Everyone feels sympathetic to Holly and there will definitely be a few nerves on set on Monday morning.</p><p>“Everyone is anxious for her return to the show to go well, but crew will do their best to make her welcome.</p><p>“Holly is clearly feeling anxious about things, but at the same time she’s determined to address it.”</p><p>Later in the week, Holly will be joined by Irish presenter Craig Doyle, while <a href=#>Alison Hammond</a> and Dermot O’Leary will be back for their usual slot on Friday. &nbsp;</p><p>Holly is now said to be thinking about the future of This Morning — and is keen to move into a new era for the flagship daytime show.</p><p>It comes as the Sun on Sunday revealed last week that former show contributor Dr Ranj Singh complained to bosses of bullying and a toxic atmosphere on set.</p><p>On Friday, former This Morning head of news Emily Maddick claimed she <a href=#>quit after two months</a> over “bullying, sexism and a toxic culture of fear and intimidation” on the show.</p><p>An insider said: “Phillip’s departure was unexpected and a shock for everyone on the series.</p><p>“But Holly knows change isn’t necessarily a bad thing. She wants to put her best foot forward and help be a part of the shift backstage, where everyone is happy.</p><p>“Obviously, the reports of on-set toxicity have been upsetting to hear and Holly hopes this is the start of new era for the show and that they can pull together.</p><p>“Producers are hopeful Holly will now steer the ship towards calmer waters for the next six weeks before her summer break.”</p><p>Our source said when Holly is off for the summer, “bigger decisions will be made about a rebrand of the show, with new credits and a soundtrack to signify the new era — and distance itself from Phil’s reign”.</p><p>Last week, Phillip said <a href=#>he texted Holly</a> as the affair story broke, writing: “I know you can’t reply, you’re probably not allowed, but please know I’m desperately sorry.”</p><p>Our source said Holly has still not made contact with Phillip, but is saddened that he has been suffering with his mental health.</p><p>They added: “Holly hasn’t engaged with Phil, but is upset he has been feeling so low.”</p><p>Holly has not commented since<a href=#> taking to social media</a> last weekend to reveal Phillip had lied to her about his affair.</p><p>She wrote last Saturday: “It’s taken time to process yesterday’s news. When reports of this relationship first surfaced, I asked Phil directly if this was true and was told it was not. It’s been very hurtful to now find out this was a lie.”</p><p>On Friday’s This Morning, <a href=#>Alison broke down in tears</a> as she discussed The Sun’s exclusive interview with Phillip, in which he spoke of feeling suicidal.</p><p>She said she feared he could only take so much.</p><p>Alison, who has worked on the show with Phillip for more than two decades, was struggling when it came to the newspaper review.</p><p>For days, This Morning had ignored the fall-out of Phillip’s admission about his affair, despite the story being splashed across The Sun’s front pages.</p><p>But on Friday, &nbsp;presenters took time to discuss his <a href=#>exclusive interview with The Sun</a>.</p><p>Alison appeared alongside co-presenter Dermot when she admitted she was finding the scandal difficult to process.</p><p>Dermot told viewers: “It’s very difficult for us to cover this story because he’s a friend and a colleague.”</p><p>Tearful Alison continued: “I’m just finding it really painful because obviously I loved Phillip Schofield and it’s weird because I still love Phillip Schofield.</p><p>“However what he has done is wrong. He’s admitted it. He’s said sorry but, as a family, we’re all really struggling to process.”</p><p>She later admitted she feared for Phillip’s <a href=#>mental health</a>, adding: “There is so much a man can take isn’t there? I don’t want any death in this situation.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Alison and Dermot had not spoken publicly at length about Phillip’s exit before Friday’s segment.</p><p>The Sun on Sunday has contacted <a href=#>This Morning</a> and Holly for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sun_Instagram_image_download__181337jpg-JS820959596-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqYmqEcYOYbWahp5yhxm7DyKWjqK2Xna%2B6ecCdm6udo6iytHnPoaClpJmlerSvx6idop2cmXqpu82eqq2xXam1qr%2BMpqarppmjtHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./don-koch-obituary-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hot News!
